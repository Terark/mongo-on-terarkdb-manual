More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]\'s imperialist expansion ? in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France\'s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.\" {{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Benedict | author-link = Benedict Anderson | title = In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = II | issue = 28 | pages = 85?129 | publisher = New Left Review | date = July?August 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/II/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .}} </blockquote> According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].</ref>\n\nNumerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie Fran?ois Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} McKinley\'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = American Experience {{!}} Emma Goldman {{!}} Transcript {{!}} PBS|url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/filmmore/pt.html|website = www.pbs.org|access-date = 2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nPropaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914?1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===\n{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)||Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Revolutions of 1917?23}}\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]\nAnarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}</ref> However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed.

Its [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.\nNOTE: Since it is the ratio of all reflected radiation to incident radiation it will include the diffuse AND the specular radiation reflected. It is, however, common to assume a surface reflects in either a totally specular manner or a totally diffuse manner, as this can simplify calculations.\n\nAlbedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.\n\nThe albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] sustainable-rating systems for buildings.

These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.<ref name=\"BlueskyAlbedo\"/>\n\n==Astronomical albedo==\nThe albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.\n\n[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.

The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.<ref name=Winston>{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818?827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099<0818:TACOZM>2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}</ref> The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.<ref name=Winston/>\n\n===Insolation effects ===\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]] (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Climate and weather===\nAlbedo affects [[climate]] and drives [[weather]]. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of [[air masses]], depending on latitude and therefore [[insolation]]: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into [[pressure systems]]. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the [[Coriolis effect]] further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the [[jet stream]]s.\n\n===Albedo?temperature feedback===\nWhen an area\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow?temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow?temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.\n\n===Snow===\nSnow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.<ref>Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.</ref> Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice?albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.<ref name = \"Nat. Geo\">[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 \"Changing Greenland ? Melt Zone\"] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in \'\'[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]\'\' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010</ref>\nHence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.\n\n===Small-scale effects===\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.<ref name=\"ranknfile-ue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool!

For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions.

In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187?190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969}}</ref> Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]].

They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.<ref name=\"Betts\" />\n\n===Water===\nWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).\n[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&nbsp;?C (refractive index=1.333)]]\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.<ref name=\"Fresnel\" />\n\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.\n\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \'black\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\n\n===Clouds===\n[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.

According to Barbara Branden, the change was made for dramatic reasons??Rand believed that titling the novel \'The Strike\' would have revealed the mystery element of the novel prematurely.\"\n\nShe did this with all of her novels, giving them titles that would help remind her what the central theme was, but then changing the titles to something that would not be understood by the reader until after the novel had been read. This is explained in Anthem Centennial Edition with Introduction by Ayn Rand (ISBN-10: 0452286352 ISBN-13: 978-0452286351), at least.\n\nThe above sentence makes it appear it is a quality of the book, while it should emphasize it was really a quality of the author\'s style.\n\nFor example:\nAirtight became We The Living\nEgo became Anthem\nSecond Hand Lives became The Fountainhead\n\nSmall suggestion to an excellent article. <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">?Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/199.80.142.62|199.80.142.62]] ([[User talk:199.80.142.62|talk]]) 19:08, 18 September 2009 </span><!-- Template:UnsignedIP -->\n\n== \"100 best novels of the 20th century\" blurb should be removed [uncredible source]. ==\n\nThe source being used is an Internet poll: http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/\n\nWhich is highly sensitive to \'blitz voting\', which is also why non-professional reviews on Metacritic are rarely used, and even looking at that list 4 out of the top 10 are Rand books, and 3 out of the top 10 are Hubbard\'s, showing a very high Libertarian slant. It\'s not nearly as subject-varied as the professional list on that same page (which doesn\'t include the book in its top 100). <span style=\"font-size: smaller;\" class=\"autosigned\">?

(UTC)</span><!-- Template:Unsigned IP -->\n\n== Sourcing ==\n\nI\'ve just tagged a few paragraphs for sourcing issues but could tag many more. For example, we say that John Galt expresses Rand\'s personal opinion but we don\'t seem to have any verification of that: he is just a character in a novel. Novelists create many characters, some traits of which may reflect the writer\'s own opinion while other traits may not; or none may be a reflection; or (in rare cases) all may be a reflection. We cannot interpret primary sources, such as the book itself, because that constitutes [[WP:OR|original research]]. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 11:35, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n:I\'ve just tagged the entire \"Theory of sex\" section as OR. The rationale should be obvious. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:46, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n::Rand refers to and quotes from Galt\'s speech in her philosophical essays, confirming that his words reflected her views. There\'s not interpretation required, so no possibility of original research. [[User:MilesMoney|MilesMoney]] ([[User talk:MilesMoney|talk]]) 05:58, 23 October 2013 (UTC)\n\n== Reason magazine ==\n\nWe currently say \"... the title of the libertarian magazine, \'\'Reason: Free Minds, Free Markets\'\', is taken directly from John Galt ...\". That is unsourced, although a quote from Galt is present. What concerns me more is that a look at [[Reason (magazine)]] and in particular at the image shown in the infobox there suggests that \'\'Free Minds, Free Markets\'\' is a strapline, not a title. The article title itself seems to bear that out, so perhaps this sentence needs to be tweaked as well as sourced? - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:03, 22 October 2013 (UTC)\n:Based on http://cloudfront-assets.reason.com/assets/db/1350587890858.pdf, it\'s a strapline, albeit one that\'s used consistently and prominently. It\'s also found in it\'s self-description at http://reason.com/about. I don\'t believe there\'s any doubt that Rand is the source of the quote.

In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a [[pictogram]] of an ox head in [[proto-Sinaitic script]]<ref name=Coll>{{harvnb|Hall-Quest|1997|p=1}}</ref> influenced by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.\n\nIn 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]] aleph.\n\n{| cellspacing=\"10\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"background-color: white; float: right;\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:BlackletterA-01.png|Blackletter A]]<br />[[Blackletter]] A\n|[[File:UncialA-01.svg|Uncial A]]<br />[[Uncial script|Uncial]] A\n|[[File:Acap.svg|Another Capital A]]<br />Another Blackletter A&nbsp;\n|- align=\"center\"\n|[[File:ModernRomanA-01.svg|64 px|Modern Roman A]]<br />Modern Roman A\n|[[File:Modern Italic A.svg|64 px|Modern Italic A]]<br />Modern Italic A\n|[[File:Modern Script A.svg|64 px|Modern Script A]]<br />Modern script A\n|}\nWhen the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]]?the consonant sound that the letter denoted in [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], and that was the first [[phoneme]] of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter?so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and called it by the similar name of [[alpha]]. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\n\nThe [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic script|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin|Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.\n\n===Typographic variants===\n[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of the lowercase letter A.]]\nDuring Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" mediums. There was also a [[cursive]] style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there as not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as [[letter case|majuscule]] cursive, [[letter case|minuscule]] cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early [[Uncial script#Half-uncial|semi-uncial]], the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.<ref name=Americana>{{harvnb|Diringer|2000|p=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LowercaseA.svg|left|thumb|200px|Typographic variants include a double-storey \'\'\'a\'\'\' and single-storey \'\'\'?\'\'\'.]]At the end of the [[Roman Empire]] (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[Italy]], the [[Merovingian script]] in France, the [[Visigothic script]] in Spain, and the [[Insular script|Insular]] or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the [[Carolingian minuscule|Caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.<ref name=Americana/>\n\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \'\'Italic\'\' and \'\'Roman\'\' forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \'\'script a,\'\' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|\"a\"}}).<ref name=Americana/> Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\n\n[[Italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). However, there are also some other cases aside from this where \'\'script a\'\' ({{Unicode|\"?\"}}), also called [[Latin alpha]], is used in contrast with Latin \"a\" (such as in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]).\n\n==Use in writing systems==\n\n===English===\n{{further|Pronunciation of English ?a?}}\nIn modern [[English orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents seven different vowel sounds:\n*the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/?/}} as in \'\'pad\'\';\n*the [[open back unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/??/}} as in \'\'father\'\', which is closer to its original Latin and Greek sound;<ref name=Coll/>\n*the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/e?/}} as in \'\'ace\'\' and \'\'major\'\' (usually when {{vr|a}} is followed by one, or occasionally two, consonants and then another vowel letter) ? this results from [[Middle English lengthening]] followed by the [[Great Vowel Shift]];\n*the modified form of the above sound that occurs [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/|before {{vr|r}}]], as in \'\'square\'\' and \'\'Mary\'\';\n*the rounded vowel of \'\'water\'\';\n*the shorter rounded vowel (not present in [[General American]]) in \'\'was\'\' and \'\'what\'\';<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n*a [[schwa]], in many unstressed syllables, as in \'\'about\'\', \'\'comma\'\', \'\'solar\'\'.  \n\nThe double {{angbr|aa}} sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \'\'Aaron\'\' and \'\'aardvark\'\'.<ref>{{harvnb|Gelb|Whiting|1998|p=45}}</ref> However, {{vr|a}} occurs in [[List of Latin-script digraphs|many common digraphs]], all with their own sound or sounds, particularly {{vr|ai}}, {{vr|au}}, {{vr|aw}}, {{vr|ay}}, {{vr|ea}} and {{vr|oa}}. \n\n{{angbr|a}} is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after {{angbr|e}} and {{angbr|t}}),<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2004}}</ref> and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English texts tend to be {{angbr|a}}, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2006}}</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, {{angbr|a}} denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as {{IPA|/[[Open front unrounded vowel|a]]/}}, {{IPA|/[[Open central unrounded vowel|?]]/}}, or {{IPA|/[[Open back unrounded vowel|?]]/}}. An exception is [[Saanich dialect|Saanich]], in which {{angbr|a}} (and the glyph [[?]]) stands for a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|/e/}}.\n\n===Other systems===\n\nIn phonetic and phonemic notation:\n*in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{angbr|{{IPA|a}}}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]], {{angbr|{{IPA|?}}}} is used for the [[open central unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|{{IPA|?}}}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].\n*in [[X-SAMPA]], {{angbr|a}} is used for the [[open front unrounded vowel]] and {{angbr|A}} is used for the [[open back unrounded vowel]].\n\n==Other uses==\n{{main|A (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[algebra]], the letter \"A\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.\n\nIn [[geometry]], capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote [[Line segment|segment]]s, [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[Line (geometry)#Ray|rays]], etc.<ref name=Americana/> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.<ref name=Coll/>\n\nIn [[logic]], A is used to signify the [[Categorical proposition|universal affirmative]].\n\nIn [[physics]], A is the [[SI]] unit symbol for [[Ampere]].\n\n\"A\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students\' schoolwork; \"A grade\" for clean restaurants; [[A-list]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.<ref>{{harvnb|British Psychological Society|2010}}</ref>\n\nFinally, the letter A is used to denote size,{{where|date=October 2015}} as in a narrow size shoe,<ref name=Coll/> or a small cup size in a [[brassiere]].{{cn|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Related characters==\n<!-- Please only list characters (symbols in a writing system, but not just convenience codepoints in Unicode) that are actually related in terms of origin to the letter that is the topic of this article.

Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"Historical Populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.\n\nAt the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the \"Magic City\". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the state\'s population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.\n\n<blockquote>Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter -steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial \"[[gerrymandering]]\" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.<ref name=\"vra\">James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown and Royal Dumas.

They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.\n\nOne result was that [[Jefferson County, Alabama|Jefferson County]], containing Birmingham\'s industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"<ref name=\"pjhwpa\"/>\n\nA class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in [[Lowndes County, Alabama]] challenged the state legislature\'s lack of redistricting for congressional seats. In 1962 \'\'[[White v. Crook]]\'\', Judge [[Frank M. Johnson]] ordered the state to redistrict. United States Supreme Court cases of \'\'[[Baker v. Carr]]\'\' (1962) and \'\'[[Reynolds v. Sims]]\'\' (1964) ruled that the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.\n\nIn 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.<ref name=\"pjhwpa\"/> Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.\n\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955?1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], including legal challenges. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in \'\'[[Brown v. Board of Education]]\'\' that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor [[George Wallace]], Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for [[desegregation]].The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955?56), [[Freedom Rides]] in 1961, and 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]].

There is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies. This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.\n \nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, \'\'[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]],\'\' challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cites and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|A general map of Alabama]]\n{{Main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2330 |title=Food Production in Alabama |last1=Ijaz |first1=Ahmad |last2=Addy |first2=Samuel N. |date=July 6, 2009 |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\"/>\n\nAccording to the U.S. [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the 2008 total [[gross state product]] was $170&nbsp;billion, or $29,411 per capita.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Alabama Supreme Court]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In \'\'[[Reynolds v. Sims]]\'\' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already had in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, it ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems. At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n\nThe [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]]. The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is Republican [[Kay Ivey]].\n\nThe [[Judiciary|judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The [[State supreme court|state\'s highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]. Alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges, and since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized.<ref name=\"AJS\">[http://www.judicialselection.us/judicial_selection/index.cfm?state=AL Judicial Selection in the States: Alabama], American Judicature Society.</ref> The current [[chief justice]] of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican [[Roy Moore]]. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate [[appellate court]]s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four [[trial court]]s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.<ref name=\"AJS\"/>\n\nThe members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections.

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators are buried in local county issues.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in \'\'[[Baker v. Carr]]\'\' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

Bentley]], governor since January 17, 2011]]\n[[File:Kay Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Kay Ivey]], lieutenant governor]]\n\nDuring [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955?1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when Whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat [[George Wallace]], the state\'s only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the Federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican Governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.\n\n===Elections===\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n\n====State elections====\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of African Americans]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late-20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |work=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html| archivedate= August 2, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy, Press-Register |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher= al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110513135614/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html| archivedate= May 13, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nOnly two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Another interstate, [[Interstate 22 in Alabama|I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed, it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: [[Interstate 165|I-165]] in Mobile, [[Interstate 359|I-359]] in Tuscaloosa, [[Interstate 459|I-459]] around Birmingham, [[Interstate 565|I-565]] in Decatur and Huntsville, and [[Interstate 759|I-759]] in Gadsden. A sixth route, [[Interstate 685|I-685]], will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as [[Interstate 422|I-422]]. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, [[Interstate 222|I-222]] has been proposed, as well.\n\nSeveral U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11 in Alabama|U.S. Route&nbsp;11]] (US-11), [[U.S. Route 29 in Alabama|US-29]], [[U.S. Route 31 in Alabama|US-31]], [[U.S. Route 43 in Alabama|US-43]], [[U.S. Route 45 in Alabama|US-45]], [[U.S. Route 72 in Alabama|US-72]], [[U.S. Route 78 in Alabama|US-78]], [[U.S. Route 80 in Alabama|US-80]], [[U.S. Route 82 in Alabama|US-82]], [[U.S. Route 84 in Alabama|US-84]], [[U.S. Route 90 in Alabama|US-90]], [[U.S. Route 98 in Alabama|US-98]], [[U.S. Route 231 in Alabama|US-231]], [[U.S. Route 278 in Alabama|US-278]], [[U.S. Route 280 in Alabama|US-280]], [[U.S. Route 331 in Alabama|US-331]], [[U.S. Route 411 in Alabama|US-411]], and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|US-431]].\n\nThere are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]; Tuscaloosa Bypass in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]; Emerald Mountain Expressway in [[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]; and Beach Express in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]].\n\n===Ports===\nThe [[Port of Mobile]], Alabama\'s only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].

Reverse: [[Thetis]], wearing [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]] and holding shield of Achilles with his AX monogram.]]\n{{Greek myth}}\nIn [[Greek mythology]], \'\'\'Achilles\'\'\' ({{IPAc-en|?|?|k|?|l|i?|z}}; {{lang-grc|????????}}, \'\'Akhilleus\'\', {{IPA-el|ak?il??u?s|pron}}) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] hero of the [[Trojan War]] and the central character and greatest warrior of [[Homer]]\'s \'\'[[Iliad]]\'\'. His mother was the [[nymph]] [[Thetis]], and his father, [[Peleus]], was the king of the [[Myrmidons]].\n\nAchilles? most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the \'\'Iliad\'\', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term \'\'[[Achilles\' heel]]\'\' has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness.\n\n== Etymology ==\nAchilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{lang|grc|????}} (\'\'akhos\'\') \"grief\" and {{lang|grc|????}} (\'\'laos\'\') \"a people, tribe, nation.\" In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the \'\'Iliad\'\' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ????? \'\'kleos\'\' (\"glory\", usually glory in war).\n\n\'\'Laos\'\' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nagy|first1=Gregory|title=The best of the Achaeans|url=http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5442|website=http://chs.harvard.edu|publisher=The Center for Hellenic Studies|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> following Leonard Palmer, to mean \"a corps of soldiers\", a [[muster (military)|muster]]. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.\n\n[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin of the name.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], \'\'Etymological Dictionary of Greek\'\', Brill, 2009, pp. 183?4.</ref>\n\nThe name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.<ref>[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for ????-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&bookid=6&region=2&subregion=1 Corinth 7th c.

(\'\'Achille?a\'\') attested in Attica in the 4th century BC ([[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II? 1617) and, in the form \'\'Achillia\'\', on a [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|stele in Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting an \"Amazon\".\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 181.jpg|thumb|\'\'Thetis Dipping the Infant Achilles into the River Styx\'\' (ca. 1625), [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]\n\nAchilles was the son of the [[Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.<ref>[[Aeschylus]], \'\'Prometheus Bound\'\' 755?768; [[Pindar]], \'\'Nemean\'\' 5.34?37, \'\'Isthmian\'\' 8.26?47; \'\'[[Poeticon astronomicon]]\'\' (ii.15)</ref>\n\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in \'\'[[Argonautica]]\'\' (iv.760) Zeus\' sister and wife [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god [[Nereus]], was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.<!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:\"Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.\"-->\n\n[[File:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|left|\'\'The Education of Achilles\'\' (ca. 1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]\n\nAccording to the \'\'[[Achilleid]]\'\', written by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel<ref>{{cite book| last = Burgess| first = Jonathan S.| title = The Death and Afterlife of Achilles| url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ko_YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA9| accessdate = 5 February 2010| year = 2009| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press| location = Baltimore| isbn = 0-8018-9029-2| page = 9 }}</ref> (see [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles\' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.<ref>[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], \'\'[[Argonautica]]\'\' 4.869?879.</ref>\n\nHowever, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the \'\'Iliad\'\' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles\' elbow, \"drawing a spurt of blood\".\n\nAlso, in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero\'s death, \'\'[[Cypria]]\'\' (unknown author), \'\'[[Aithiopis]]\'\' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], \'\'[[Little Iliad]]\'\' by Lesche of Mytilene, \'\'[[Iliou persis]]\'\' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles\' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.\n\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be reared.<ref>[[Hesiod]], \'\'Catalogue of Women\'\', fr. 204.87?89 MW; \'\'Iliad\'\' 11.830-32</ref>\n\n== Achilles in the Trojan War ==\n[[File:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|\'\'The Rage of Achilles\'\', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]\n\nThe first two lines of the \'\'Iliad\'\' read:\n:{{lang|grc|????? ????? ??? ????????? ???????}}\n:{{lang|grc|?????????, ? ????\' ??????? ????\' ??????,}}\n\n:Sing, Goddess, of the rage of Peleus\' son Achilles,\n:the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]].\n\nAchilles\' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAccording to the \'\'Iliad\'\', Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 [[Myrmidons]] (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).\n\n=== Telephus ===\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that \"he that wounded shall heal\". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Apollodorus|title=Library of Mythology Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}</ref>\n\nAccording to other reports in [[Euripides]]\' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles\' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Apollodorus|title=Library of Mythology Epitome 3.20|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#69|website=theoi.com|ref=69}}</ref>\n\n=== Troilus ===\nAccording to the \'\'[[Cypria]]\'\' (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles\' Wrath), when the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of [[Aeneas]], sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].<ref name=\"stoa.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus\' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Dares Phrygius]]\' \'\'Account of the Destruction of Troy\'\',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html |title=Dares\' account of the destruction of Troy, Greek Mythology Link |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=9 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091229022803/http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html| archivedate= 29 December 2009<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, [[Troilus]] was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King [[Priam]]\'s (or sometimes [[Apollo]]) and [[Hecuba]]\'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus\' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth&nbsp;? who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers\' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles\' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.<ref>James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html \"Zeus Be Nice Now\"] in \'\'London Review of Books;\'\' 19 July 2007, access date 23 October 2007</ref> Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed, Troy would have been invincible.\n\n=== Achilles in the \'\'Iliad\'\' ===\n{{main|Iliad}}\n[[File:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th-century illuminated manuscript]]\n\nHomer\'s \'\'Iliad\'\' is the most famous narrative of Achilles\' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles\' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles\' death. It begins with Achilles\' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles\' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis),<ref>\'\'Iliad\'\' 9.334?343.</ref> with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon\'s theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.\n\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him, and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.\n\nThe Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] leads the [[Myrmidons]] into battle wearing Achilles\' armor, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector\'s lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]] (from a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]).]]\n\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion\'s death and holds many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades [[Hephaestus]] to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor includes the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail in the poem.\n\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles\' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector\'s favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that \"my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw ? such agonies you have caused me\".<ref>\"The Iliad\", Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.</ref> Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot during Patroclus\' funeral games.\n\nWith the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector\'s father, [[Priam]], goes to Achilles\' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector\'s body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector\'s funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.\n\n=== Penthesilea ===\nAchilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.\n\n=== Memnon, and the fall of Achilles ===\n[[File:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]\n\nFollowing the death of Patroclus, Achilles\' closest companion was Nestor\'s son [[Antilochus]]. When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.\n\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \'\'Iliad\'\'\'s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles\' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] \'\'[[Aethiopis]]\'\', which was composed after the \'\'Iliad\'\', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The \'\'Aethiopis\'\' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.\n\n{{anchor|Fatalwound}}\nThe death of Achilles, as predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, was brought about by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris\' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.\n\n[[File:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure \'\'[[lekythos]]\'\', ca. 510 BC, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]]\nAll of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented in the \'\'Aethiopis\'\' as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]].\n\nAnother version of Achilles\' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena\'s hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world\'s greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.\n\nAchilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.<ref>Hamilton E. Mythology, New York: Penguin Books; 1969</ref>\n\nParis was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].\n\n=== Fate of Achilles\' armor ===\nAchilles\' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.\n\nA relic claimed to be Achilles\' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the \'\'Iliad\'\' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear.<ref>\"Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles\' original spear.\" Robin Lane Fox, \'\'Alexander the Great\'\' 1973.144.</ref> However, it was shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.<ref>Pausanias, iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, \"The Greek Traveler\'s Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias\' Description of Greece\", \'\'Yale French Studies\'\' \'\'\'59\'\'\': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65?85) esp. p. 81.</ref>\n\n[[File:Achilles Ajax dice Louvre MNB911.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Achilles and Ajax playing the board game \'\'Petteia\'\'.

In the \'\'Iliad\'\', it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship.

In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|Greek custom of \'\'paiderasteia\'\']]. In Plato\'s \'\'Symposium\'\', the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover.<ref>[[Plato]], \'\'[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]\'\', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Sym.+180a 180a]; the beauty of Achilles was a topic already broached at \'\'Iliad\'\' 2.673?4.</ref> But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish [[heterosexual]] and homosexual,<ref>[[Kenneth Dover]], \'\'Greek Homosexuality\'\' (Harvard University Press, 1978, 1989), p. 1 \'\'et passim\'\'.</ref> and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.\n\n== Worship of Achilles in antiquity ==\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Briseis and Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|Achilles and Briseis]]\n[[File:Achilles killing the Amazon Queen Penthesilea.jpg|thumb|right|Penthesilea brought her Amazon warriors to help the Trojans defend their city but was killed in combat by Achilles. Here, Achilles looms above her as she sinks to the ground.]]\nThere was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, \'\'Leuce\'\']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.<ref>Guy Hedreen, \"The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine\" \'\'Hesperia\'\' \'\'\'60\'\'\'.3 (July 1991), pp. 313?330.</ref>\n\nIn the lost epic \'\' [[Aithiopis]]\'\', a continuation of the \'\'Iliad\'\' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]], Achilles? mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a [[tumulus]] for him and celebrated funeral games.\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny\'s]] \'\'[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]\'\'<ref>IV.27.1</ref> mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (\'\'Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara\'\'), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is \"covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles? temple and his statue\".<ref>III.19.11</ref> Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.\n\n[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister.<ref>\'\'De situ orbis\'\', II, 7</ref> The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called \'\'Leuce\'\' \"because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor\".<ref>\'\'Orbis descriptio\'\', v. 541, quoted in Densu?ianu 1913</ref>\n\nThe \'\'[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]\'\' gives the following details: \"It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus? honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles? temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles? honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles? oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn?t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships\". (quoted in Densu?ianu)\n\nThe heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.\n\nAchilles from Leuce island was venerated as \'\'Pontarches\'\' the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densu?ianu]] (Densu?ianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (\"Achileii\"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.\"\n\nLeuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (\'\'aquae\'\') on the island.\n\n=== Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu ===\nIn the region of Gastouri (????????) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] Greece, Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: \'\'[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]\'\' (?????????). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].\n\n== Other stories ==\n[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ???????? i.e. Achilles]]\n{{main|Achilles on Skyros}}\n\nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]]. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes\' daughters, perhaps under the name \"Pyrrha\" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes\' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father\'s possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles\' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women\'s clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes\' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.<ref>[[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], \'\'Imagines\'\' i; Scholiast on Homer\'s Iliad, xix. 326; [[Ovid]], \'\'Metamorphoses\'\' 13.162ff., Pseudo-Apollodorus, \'\'[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]\'\' iii. 13. 8, [[Statius]], [[Achilleid]], ii. 167ff.</ref>\n\nIn book 11 of Homer\'s \'\'[[Odyssey]]\'\', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as \"blessed in life, blessed in death\", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son\'s exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus\' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical \"White Island\" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.\n\nThe kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.<ref>[[Arrian]], \'\'[[Anabasis Alexandri]]\'\' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], \'\'Pro Archia Poeta\'\' 24.</ref> In AD 216 the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles\' tumulus.<ref>[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.</ref>\n\nAchilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades&nbsp;? as Hera promised Thetis in [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]]\' \'\'[[Argonautica]]\'\'. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].\n\n== Achilles in Greek tragedy ==\n{{main|Achilleis (trilogy)}}\n\nThe [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title \'\'Achilleis\'\' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the \'\'Achilleis\'\' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the \'\'Achilleis\'\' trilogy, \'\'The Myrmidons\'\', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.<ref>Pantelis Michelakis, \'\'Achilles in Greek Tragedy\'\', 2002, p. 22</ref> In Plato\'s \'\'Symposium\'\', Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.<ref>Plato, \'\'Symposium\'\', translated Benjamin Jowett, Dover Thrift Editions, page 8</ref>\n\nThe tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote \'\'The Lovers of Achilles\'\', a play with Achilles as the main character.

Lincoln led the United States through its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]?its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis.<ref>{{cite book|author=William A.

Largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[Illinois]], a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party leader]], and a member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]], in which he served for twelve years. Elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1846, Lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads. Because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in Congress, and because his opposition to the [[Mexican?American War]] was unpopular among Illinois voters, Lincoln returned to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] and resumed his successful law practice. Reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which had a statewide majority in Illinois. In 1858, while taking part in a [[Lincoln?Douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]], Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the U.S. Senate race to Douglas.\n\nIn 1860, Lincoln secured the Republican Party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state. With very little support in the slaveholding states of the South, he swept the North and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]. His victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[Confederate States of America]] before he moved into the [[White House]] - no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. Subsequently, on April 12, 1861, a Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]] inspired the North to enthusiastically rally behind the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in a declaration of war. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, [[War Democrats]], who called for more compromise, anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political [[patronage]], and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory.<ref>Randall (1947), pp. 65?87.</ref> His [[Gettysburg Address]] became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy.\n\nLincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He suspended [[habeas corpus]], leading to the controversial \'\'[[ex parte Merryman]]\'\' decision, and he averted potential British intervention in the war by defusing the [[Trent Affair]] in late 1861. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He also made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South\'s normal trade, moves to take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through Congress the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery.\n\nAn exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to the War Democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. Anticipating the war\'s conclusion, Lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. On April 14, 1865, five days after the April 9th surrender of Confederate commanding general [[Robert E. Lee]], Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a Confederate sympathizer.\n\nLincoln has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars<ref name=\"Ranking Our Presidents\">[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf \"Ranking Our Presidents\"].

On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.<ref>Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union\'\' (1959) vol 5 p 29</ref>\n\n[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the South was preparing for war.<ref>Sherman, pp. 185?186.</ref> Donald concludes that, \"His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft.

The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.\"<ref>Donald (1996), p. 293.</ref>\n\nOn April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.<ref name=\"Oates, p. 226\">Oates, p. 226.</ref> The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to the defense of the American nation.

On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains, and local leaders\' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials.

He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending \'\'habeas corpus\'\', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 303?304; Carwardine (2003), pp. 163?164.</ref>\n\n[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=A group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|\"Running the \'Machine\'&nbsp;\": An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln\'s administration?featuring [[William Fessenden]], [[Edwin Stanton]], [[William H.

From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue.

The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the \'\'Trent\'\', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain.<ref name=\"CFAdams\">Adams, pp. 540?562.</ref> Lincoln\'s foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward.

He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. \"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together,\" say Thomas and Hyman.<ref>Benjamin P.

McClellan]] general-in-chief of all the Union armies.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 318?319.</ref> McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign\'s objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan\'s repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan\'s troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 349?352.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|250px|Lincoln and [[George B.

Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]].<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 339?340.</ref>\n\nDespite his dissatisfaction with McClellan\'s failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.<ref>Goodwin, pp. 478?479.</ref> Two days after McClellan\'s return to command, General [[Robert E.

As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]].

At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 444?447.</ref>\nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans.

He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], under the constitution.<ref name=\"Mackubin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp|title=The Liberator|first=Thomas Owens|last=Mackubin|date=March 25, 2004|work=National Review|publisher=National Review|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a7fJ9hj|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}</ref> President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Fr?mont in August 1861 and by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.<ref>Guelzo (1999), pp. 290?291.</ref>\n\nOn June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress\'s power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that \"as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free\".<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 364?365.</ref>\n\nPrivately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the highly influential \'\'New York Tribune\'\' fell for the ploy,<ref>McPherson (1992), p. 124.</ref> and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the U.S. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his \"official duty\") was that of preserving the Union:<ref>Guelzo (2004), pp. 147?153.</ref>\n\n{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union&nbsp;... [?] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.<ref>Basler (1953), p. 388</ref>}}\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 364, 379.</ref> Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.<ref>Louis P. Masur, \'\'Lincoln\'s Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union\'\' (Harvard University Press; 2012)</ref>\n\nOnce the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln\'s comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\"<ref>Donald (1996), p. 407.</ref> For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.<ref>Donald (1996), p. 408.</ref> A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors\' Conference]]; they supported the president\'s Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.<ref>Nevins (1960), pp. 2:239?240.</ref>\n\nEnlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to [[Andrew Johnson]], the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, \"The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once\".<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 430?431.</ref> By the end of 1863, at Lincoln\'s direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.<ref>Donald (1996), p. 431.</ref> [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed of Lincoln: \"In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color\".<ref>Douglass, pp. 259?260.</ref>\n\n===Gettysburg Address (1863)===\n{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}\n[[File:Lincoln\'s Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|300px|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before [[Gettysburg Address|the speech]].]]\nWith the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the [[New York City draft riots]].

He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 460?466.</ref><ref>Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.</ref>\n\n===General Grant===\n[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship\'s cabin, entitled \"The Peacemakers\".|thumb|300px|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Ulysses S.

General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]\'s victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can\'t spare this man. He fights.\"<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 315.</ref> With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.<ref>Nevins, \'\'Ordeal of the Union\'\' (Vol. IV), pp. 6?17.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant\'s political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant\'s promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress\'s consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 490?492.</ref>\n\nGrant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had \"almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces\".<ref>McPherson (2009), p. 113.</ref> The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant\'s plans were, to which the general replied, \"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\"<ref>Donald (1996), p. 501.</ref>\n\nThe Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee\'s army shrank with every costly battle. Grant\'s army moved south, crossed the [[James River]], forcing a siege and trench warfare outside [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant\'s headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.<ref name=\"whitehousehistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html|title=The Peacemakers|publisher=The White House Historical Association|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a8J9jOa|archivedate=October 20, 2011|deadurl=}}</ref> Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.<ref>Thomas (2008), pp. 422?424.</ref>\n\nLincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure?such as plantations, railroads, and bridges?hoping to destroy the South\'s morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant\'s move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and [[Philip Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia\'s [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman\'s March to the Sea]] through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a {{convert|60|mi|km|adj=on}} swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies.

During Early\'s [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\"<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 434.</ref> After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 516?518.</ref>\n\nAs Grant continued to wear down Lee\'s forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.<ref>Donald (1996), p. 565.</ref> On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee\'s forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero.

Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together?and holding together?all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M.

Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers?greatly expanded over peacetime?to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket.<ref>Fish, pp. 53?69.</ref><ref>Tegeder, pp. 77?90.</ref> At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate.

Shortly after Lee\'s surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, \"Let \'em up easy.\"<ref>Thomas (2008), pp. 509?512.</ref> In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 471?472.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled \"The \'Rail Splitter\' At Work Repairing the Union.\" The caption reads (Johnson): \'\'Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.\'\' (Lincoln): \'\'A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.\'\']]\n\nAs Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals [[Andrew Johnson#General|Andrew Johnson]] and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln\'s Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans\' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 485?486.</ref>\n\nLincoln\'s appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney\'s seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P.

Lincoln declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole matter\".<ref>Donald (1996), p. 561.</ref> By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864.

He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner\'s [[Freedmen\'s Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.<ref>Carwardine (2003), pp. 242?243.</ref>\n\nHistorians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. Lincoln biographers [[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:\n:It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson\'s, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson\'s mistakes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C&pg=PA80|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80}}</ref>\n\n[[Eric Foner]] argues that:\n:Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b8m7cv3wTIC&pg=PA335|year=2010|publisher=W.

The term \"the United States\" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (\"these United States\"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Presidential Proclamation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/12/presidential-proclamation-civil-war-sesquicentennial|title=Presidential Proclamation-Civil War Sesquicentennial|publisher=The White House|date=April 12, 2011|quote=...&nbsp;a new meaning was conferred on our country\'s name&nbsp;... |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62aAPoA6B|archivedate=October 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln\'s redefinition of \'\'republican values\'\'. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values?what he called the \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism.<ref>Jaffa, p. 399.</ref> The Declaration\'s emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution\'s tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"<ref>Diggins, p. 307.</ref> His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.<ref>Foner (2010), p. 215.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.<ref>Jaffa, p. 263.</ref> Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln\'s republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.<ref>Orville Vernon Burton, \'\'The Age of Lincoln\'\' (2008) p 243</ref>\n\nIn March 1861, in [[Lincoln\'s first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\"<ref>Belz (1998), p. 86.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Other enactments===\nLincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.<ref>Donald (2001), p. 137.</ref> He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States\' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.<ref>Paludan, p. 116.</ref> The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.<ref>McPherson (1993), pp. 450?452.</ref>\n\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n| Name = Lincoln\n| President = Abraham Lincoln\n| President date = 1861?1865\n| Vice President = [[Hannibal Hamlin]]\n| Vice President date = 1861?1865\n| Vice President 2 = [[Andrew Johnson]]\n| Vice President date 2 = 1865\n| State = [[William H.

In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.<ref>Donald (1996), p. 424.</ref> This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.<ref>Paludan, p. 111.</ref>\n\nLincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government\'s economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency.

Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Is??yathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).<ref>Cox, p. 182.</ref> President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.<ref>Nichols, pp. 210?232.</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Grant\'s casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the \'\'[[New York World]]\'\' and the \'\'[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]\'\' published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln\'s reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 501?502.</ref>\n\nLincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Donald 1996, p. 471\">Donald (1996), p. 471.</ref> Before Lincoln\'s presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.

[[Samuel Freeman Miller]], nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln\'s campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln\'s Illinois court circuit. [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln\'s Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864.

Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.<ref>Densen, John V., Editor, \'\'Reassessing The Presidency, The Rise of the Executive State and the Decline of Freedom\'\' (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2001), pgs. 1?32; Ridings, William H., & Stuard B. McIver, \'\'Rating The Presidents, A Ranking of U.S. Leaders, From the Great and Honorable to the Dishonest and Incompetent\'\' (Citadel Press, Kensington Publishing Corp., 2000).</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln\'s assassination increased his status to the point of making him a national martyr. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln\'s name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.<ref>Chesebrough, pp. 76, 79, 106, 110.</ref>\n\nSchwartz argues that Lincoln\'s reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900?1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the Mall in Washington.<ref>Schwartz (2000), p. 109.</ref> In the [[New Deal]] era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the [[Cold War]] years, Lincoln\'s image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.<ref>Schwartz (2009), pp. 23, 91?98.</ref>\n\nBy the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to [[Conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]]<ref>Havers, p. 96.

Harris found that Lincoln\'s \"reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism\".<ref>Harris, p. 2.</ref> James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform\". Randall concludes that, \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called \'radicalism\' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\"<ref>Randall (1947), p. 175.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian [[Lerone Bennett Jr.|Lerone Bennett]], were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln\'s views on racial issues.<ref>Zilversmit, pp. 22?24.</ref><ref>Smith, p. 42.</ref> Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.<ref>Bennett, pp. 35?42.</ref> He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed [[American Colonization Society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;<ref>Dirck (2008), p. 31.</ref> and that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.<ref>Striner, pp. 2?4.</ref> The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.<ref>Cashin, p. 61.</ref><ref>Kelley & Lewis, p. 228.</ref> Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln\'s image suffered \"erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule\" in the late 20th century.<ref>Schwartz (2009), p. 146.</ref> On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[John Keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were \"content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason\".<ref>Donald (1996), p. 15.</ref>\n\nToday\'s U.S. President, however, seems to be promoting a sympathetic resurgence for his predecessor, Lincoln.

During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world\'s disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful\". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\"<ref>Barry Schwartz, \'\'Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America\'\' (2009) pp. xi, 9, 24</ref> However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II, Lincoln\'s symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness\".

His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Aristotle |url=http://www.biography.com/people/aristotle-9188415?page=1#early-life |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref> At eighteen, he joined [[Plato\'s Academy]] in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]]&nbsp;347&nbsp;BC).

Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] starting from 343&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"philosophy1972\">Bertrand Russell, \'\'A History of Western Philosophy\'\', Simon & Schuster, 1972.</ref> According to the \'\'[[Encyclop?dia Britannica]]\'\', \"Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history&nbsp;...

He established a library in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of [[Platonism]], but, following Plato\'s death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to [[empiricism]].{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=6}} He believed all peoples\' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on [[perception]]. Aristotle\'s views on [[natural science]]s represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.\n\nAristotle\'s views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended into the [[Renaissance]] and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle\'s zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern [[formal logic]].\n\nIn metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] profoundly influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800?1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as \"The First Teacher\" ({{lang-ar|{{big|?????? ?????}}}}).\n\nHis ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].

He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47&nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy\'s direction after control passed to Plato\'s nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato died.<ref name=\"Lord Intro\">Carnes Lord, introduction to \'\'The Politics\'\' by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).</ref>\n[[File:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|250px|\"Aristotle\" by [[Francesco Hayez]] (1791?1882)]]\nAristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. There, he traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias\'s adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. Soon after Hermias\' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 343&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"philosophy1972\"/>\n\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].<ref name=\"Peter Green\">Peter Green, \'\'Alexander of Macedon\'\', University of California Press Ltd.

Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].<ref>William George Smith,\'\'Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\'\', {{vol.|3}}, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html {{p.|88}}]</ref>\n\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323&nbsp;BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.<ref name=\"philosophy1972\"/> He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include \'\'[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]\'\', \'\'[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]\'\', \'\'[[Nicomachean Ethics]]\'\', \'\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\'\', \'\'[[De Anima]]\'\' (\'\'On the Soul\'\') and \'\'[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]\'\'.\n\nAristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.\n\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander\'s relationship with Persia and Persians.

Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like \'\'[[reductio ad absurdum]]\'\' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deductive system]], he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his [[dialectic]].<ref name=\"Boche?ski, 1951\">Boche?ski, 1951.</ref>\n\nPlato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book \'\'[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]\'\', where he introduced his division method.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Rose\n | first =Lynn E.\n | title =Aristotle\'s Syllogistic\n | publisher =Charles C Thomas Publisher\n | year =1968\n | location =Springfield\n}}</ref>\n\n====Analytics and the \'\'Organon\'\'====\n{{main|Organon}}\nWhat we today call \'\'Aristotelian logic\'\', Aristotle himself would have labeled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean \'\'dialectics\'\'. Most of Aristotle\'s work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:\n#\'\'Categories\'\'\n#\'\'On Interpretation\'\'\n#\'\'Prior Analytics\'\'\n#\'\'Posterior Analytics\'\'\n#\'\'Topics\'\'\n#\'\'On Sophistical Refutations\'\'\n\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle\'s writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the \'\'Categories,\'\' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in \'\'On Interpretation\'\', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the \'\'Analytics\'\') and dialectics (in the \'\'Topics\'\' and \'\'Sophistical Refutations\'\'). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory \'\'stricto sensu\'\': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle\'s concerning logic not found in the \'\'Organon\'\', namely the fourth book of \'\'Metaphysics.\'\'<ref name=\"Boche?ski, 1951\"/>\n\n===Aristotle\'s epistemology===\n[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of \'\'[[The School of Athens]]\'\'<!--This should link to an article about the famous artwork-->, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his \'\'[[Nicomachean Ethics]]\'\' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]], while holding a copy of \'\'[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]\'\']]\n\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle\'s philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle\'s [[ontology]], however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato\'s ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, [[epistemology]] is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, \"form\" still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance (see \'\'[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]\'\', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle\'s method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato\'s is essentially deductive from \'\'[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]\'\' principles.<ref>{{cite book\n | last =Jori\n | first =Alberto\n | title =Aristotele\n | publisher =Bruno Mondadori Editore\n | year =2003\n | location =Milano\n}}</ref>\n\nIn Aristotle\'s terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of \'\'philosophy\'\' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today\'s philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. In contrast, Aristotle\'s philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.\n\nIn the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term \'\'science\'\' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (\'\'dianoia\'\') is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (\'\'Metaphysics\'\' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.\n\nIf logic (or \"analytics\") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.\n\nIn the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle\'s life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle\'s metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.\n\nAristotle\'s writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle\'s work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.\n\nHis writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his \'\'[[History of Animals]]\'\' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'History of Animals\'\', 2.3.</ref> In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle\'s theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=26 April 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]\'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun\'s rays,\" pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given \"current astronomical demonstrations\" that \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\"<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Meteorology\'\' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.</ref>\n\nIn places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving \'laws of the universe\' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today\'s scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one\'s hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.\n\nAristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the \'\'Metaphysics\'\', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]].\n\nBecause he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle\'s erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.<ref>[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. \'\'Platonism\'\', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103?104.</ref> However, Aristotle\'s scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.\n\n===Geology===\nAs quoted from [[w:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell\'s]] \'\'[[Principles of Geology]]\'\':<blockquote>\nHe [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the [[Palus Maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&nbsp;... He alludes&nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.\n\nHe says [12th chapter of his \'\'Meteorics\'\'] \'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.\' The concluding observation is as follows: \'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.\'<ref>[[wikiquote:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell]], \'\'[https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog Principles of Geology]\'\', 1832, p.17</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Physics===\n{{main|Aristotelian physics}}\n\n====Five elements====\n{{main|Classical element}}\nAristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]].\n*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid.\n*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid.\n*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas.\n*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and heat.\n*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).\n\nEach of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is \"natural motion\"?motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.\n\n====Motion====\n{{main|potentiality and actuality}}\nAristotle defined [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality \'\'as such\'\'.<ref>\'\'Physics\'\' 201a10?11, 201a27?29, 201b4?5</ref> Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because [[Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the \"as such\" to the definition is critical to understanding it.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sachs|first=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|year=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\n====Causality, the four causes==== <!--Linked from [[Retrocausality]] and [[Physics (Aristotle)]] (see [[WP:MOS#Section management]])-->\n{{main|Four causes}}\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:\n*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.\n*The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings.\n*The [[efficient cause]] is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies \'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed\' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over.\n*The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.\n\nAdditionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.\n\nAristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.\n\n====Optics====\nAristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] (after [[Mozi]] c. 400 BC) can be found in Aristotle\'s documentation of such a device in 350&nbsp;BC in \'\'Problemata\'\'. Aristotle\'s apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n====Chance and spontaneity====\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is \"from what is spontaneous\" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle\'s conception of \"chance\" it might be better to think of \"coincidence\": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.\n\nFor example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.\n\nThere is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. \"What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance\".<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Physics\'\' 2.6</ref>\n\n===Metaphysics===\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle defines metaphysics as \"the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,\" or of \"being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].\" He refers to metaphysics as \"first philosophy\", as well as \"the theologic science.\"\n\n====Substance, potentiality and actuality====\n{{see also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}\nAristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (\'\'ousia\'\') in his \'\'Metaphysics\'\' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the \'\'potential\'\' house, while the form of the substance is the \'\'actual\'\' house, namely \'covering for bodies and chattels\' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Metaphysics\'\' VIII 1043a 10?30</ref>\n\nWith regard to the change (\'\'[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]\'\') and its causes now, as he defines in his \'\'[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]\'\' and \'\'[[On Generation and Corruption]]\'\' 319b?320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (\'\'[[Dunamis|dynamis]]\'\') and actuality (\'\'[[entelecheia]]\'\') in association with the matter and the form.\n\nReferring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (\'\'dynamei\'\') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either \'act\' (\'\'poiein\'\') or \'be acted upon\' (\'\'paschein\'\'), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&nbsp;? being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&nbsp;? acting).\n\nActuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (\'\'telos\'\') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.\n<blockquote>\n\"For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.\"<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Metaphysics\'\' IX 1050a 5?10</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.\n\nWith this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Metaphysics\'\' VIII 1045a?b</ref>\n\n====Universals and particulars====\n{{main|Aristotle\'s theory of universals}}\nAristotle\'s predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.\n\nPlato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of \"uninstantiated universals\".\n\nAristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.\n\nIn addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.\n\n===Biology and medicine===\nIn Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.\n\n====Empirical research program====\n[[File:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]\n[[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|\'\'Torpedo fuscomaculata\'\']]\n[[File:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]\nAristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as \'\'[[History of Animals]]\'\', \'\'[[Generation of Animals]]\'\', and \'\'[[Parts of Animals]]\'\', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (\'\'[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]\'\') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, \'\'Octopus\'\', \'\'Sepia\'\' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (\'\'[[Argonauta argo]]\'\'). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selach? ([[selachians]]).<ref name=\"Singer, Charles 1931\">Singer, Charles. \'\'A short history of biology\'\'. Oxford 1931.</ref>\n\nAnother good example of his methods comes from the \'\'Generation of Animals\'\' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.\n\nHe gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s\' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] \'\'[[Mustelus mustelus]]\'\'.<ref>Emily Kearns, \"Animals, knowledge about,\" in \'\'[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]\'\', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.</ref>\n\n====Classification of living things====\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds, mammals and fishes.<ref name=\"BergstromDugatkin2012\">{{cite book|author1=Carl T. Bergstrom|author2=Lee Alan Dugatkin|title=Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SeaEZwEACAAJ|year=2012|publisher=Norton|isbn=978-0-393-92592-0|page=35}}</ref><ref name=\"Rhodes1974\">{{cite book|author=Frank Harold Trevor Rhodes|title=Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWGt0bff8agC|date=1 January 1974|publisher=Golden Press|isbn=978-0-307-64360-5|page=7}}</ref> His classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called \'animals with blood\' and \'animals without blood\' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates (\'animals without blood\') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled ? cephalopods ? and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).\n\nFor [[Charles Singer]], \"Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle\'s] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a \'\'scala naturae\'\'\"<ref name=\"Singer, Charles 1931\"/> Aristotle\'s \'\'History of Animals\'\' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical \"[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]\" (\'\'scala naturae\'\' or [[Great Chain of Being]]), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.<ref>Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.</ref>\n\nAristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that \"no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,\" and \"a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,\" Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.<ref>Mason, \'\'A History of the Sciences\'\' pp. 43?44</ref>\n\nIn a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the \'\'scala naturae\'\'.<ref>Mayr, \'\'The Growth of Biological Thought\'\', pp. 201?202; see also: Lovejoy, \'\'The Great Chain of Being\'\'</ref> His system had eleven grades, arranged according \"to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality\", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.\n\nAristotle also held that the level of a creature\'s perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.\n\nHe placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'De Anima\'\' II 3</ref>\n\nAristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.<ref>Mason, \'\'A History of the Sciences\'\' pp. 45</ref> Notable is Aristotle\'s division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].<ref>Guthrie, \'\'A History of Greek Philosophy\'\' Vol. 1 pp. 348</ref>\n\n====Successor: Theophrastus====\n{{main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}\n[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|220px|The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of \'\'[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]\'\' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 300 BC.]]\n\nAristotle\'s successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany?the \'\'History of Plants\'\'?which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus\' names survive into modern times, such as \'\'carpos\'\' for fruit, and \'\'pericarpion\'\' for seed vessel.\n\nRather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle\'s concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.<ref>Mayr, \'\'The Growth of Biological Thought\'\', pp. 90?91; Mason, \'\'A History of the Sciences\'\', p 46</ref>\n\n====Influence on Hellenistic medicine====\n{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle\'s ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, \'\'Classical Greek Philosophy\'\' pp. 252</ref> It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.\n\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.<ref>Mason, \'\'A History of the Sciences\'\' pp. 56</ref> Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\"<ref>Mayr, \'\'The Growth of Biological Thought\'\', pp. 90?94; quotation from p 91</ref> Aristotle\'s ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.<ref>Annas, \'\'Classical Greek Philosophy\'\', p 252</ref>\n\n===Psychology===\nAristotle\'s [[psychology]], given in his treatise \'\'[[On the Soul]]\'\' (\'\'peri psyche\'\', often known by its [[Latin]] title \'\'De Anima\'\'), posits three kinds of [[soul]] (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.\n\nFor Aristotle, the soul (\'\'psyche\'\') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the [[Hylomorphism#Body?soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ \"Psychology\"].</ref>\n\n====Memory====\n\nAccording to Aristotle, [[memory]] is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloch |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QwTHng_5RqAC&pg=PR9&dq=Aristotle+on+Memory+and+Recollection#v=onepage&q=Aristotle%20on%20Memory%20and%20Recollection&f=false |title=Aristotle on Memory and Recollection |year=2007 |page=12|isbn=90-04-16046-9 }}</ref> In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) in which Aristotle defines in \'\'De Anima\'\', as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. Aristotle believed an \"imprint\" becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}} The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory\n<ref>{{cite book |last=Carruthers |first=Mary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dntrAnqfIasC&pg=PR8&dq=The+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&q=The%20book%20of%20memory%3A%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&f=false |title=The Book of Memory: A Study of Memory in Medieval Culture |year=2007 |page=16|isbn=978-0-521-42973-3 }}</ref>\n\nAristotle uses the word \"memory\" for two basic abilities. First, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] \"imprint\" that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the \"imprint\" due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our \"imprints\" cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.\n\nAristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the \"imprint\" can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new \"imprints\". He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an \"imprint\". Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly\'s organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new \"imprints\". Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.\n\n=====Recollection=====\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or \"imprints\", people are continually weaving together new \"imprints\" of things they experience. In order to search for these \"imprints\", people search the memory itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Warren |first=Howard |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D4IXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&dq=The+history+of+the+association+of+psychology#v=onepage&q=The%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&f=false |title=A History of the Association Psychology |year=1921 |page=30}}</ref> Within the memory, if one [[experience]] is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. [[Recall (memory)|Recollection]] occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of \"images\" is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}}\n\nRecollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory \"imprint\" after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses .{{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans will remember \"imprints\" of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an \"imprint\" is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an \"imprint\" is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related \"imprints\".{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}\n\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain \"imprints\", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. These three laws make up his [[Laws of Association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|Warren|1921|p=259}}\n\n====Dreams====\n\n=====Sleep=====\nBefore understanding Aristotle\'s take on dreams, first his idea of sleep must be examined.

He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the \'\'[[Nicomachean Ethics]]\'\'.\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (\'\'ergon\'\') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the \'\'[[De Anima|psuch?]]\'\' (normally translated as \'\'soul\'\') in accordance with reason (\'\'[[logos]]\'\'). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, \'\'[[eudaimonia]]\'\', generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (\'\'?thik?\'\' \'\'[[arete (moral virtue)|aret?]]\'\'), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].</ref>\n\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (\'\'[[phronesis]]\'\') and their intellect (\'\'[[nous]]\'\') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.<ref>[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.</ref>\n\n====Politics====\n{{main|Politics (Aristotle)}}\n[[File:Aristotle-constitutions-2.png|thumb|240px|Aristotle\'s classification of [[constitution]]s]]\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled \'\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\'\'. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".<ref>Politics 1253a19?24</ref> He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity\'s defining factor among others in the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] is its [[rationality]].<ref>{{cite book |authors=Aristotle, translated by Ernest Barker and revised with introduction and notes by R.

Aristotle\'s conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ebenstein |first=Alan |author-link=Alan O. Ebenstein |author2=William Ebenstein |title=Introduction to Political Thinkers |publisher=Wadsworth Group |year=2002 |page=59}}</ref>\n\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle\'s understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (\'\'[[polis]]\'\') which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (\'\'koin?nia\'\')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29?31) -->, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together<!-- (1281a1?3) -->.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"<ref>For a different reading of social and economic processes in the \'\'Nicomachean Ethics\'\' and \'\'Politics\'\' see Polanyi, K.

And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it\'s evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.\'\'\n\n====Rhetoric and poetics====\n{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}\nAristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Poetics\'\' I 1447a</ref> For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation ? through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Poetics\'\' III</ref> Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind\'s advantages over animals.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Poetics\'\' IV</ref>\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle\'s \'\'Poetics\'\' comprised two books ? one on comedy and one on tragedy ? only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Poetics\'\' VI</ref> The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes \'\'Poetics\'\' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.<ref>Aristotle, \'\'Poetics\'\' XXVI</ref>\n\nAristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].<ref>Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&pg=PR3&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998.

Others, such as \'\'[[On Colors]],\'\' may have been produced by Aristotle\'s successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle\'s name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the \'\'De Plantis,\'\' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and [[astrological]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.<ref>Lynn Thorndike, \"Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,\" \'\'Speculum\'\' 40 (1965), pp. 674?706; Roger A.

Aristotle himself never uses the term \"esoteric\" or \"acroamatic\". For other passages where Aristotle speaks of \'\'ex?terikoi logoi\'\', see [[W. D. Ross]], \'\'Aristotle\'s Metaphysics\'\' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408?410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle\'s own works, usually refers generally to \"discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]\", rather than to specific works of Aristotle\'s own.</ref> Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the [[Lyceum]] course / school (esoteric).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp|page=35|title=Aristotles Poetics|year=1956|author=Humphry House}}</ref> Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle\'s own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).<ref name=\"Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12\">Barnes, \"Life and Work\", p. 12.</ref> However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation. The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle\'s writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that \"good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these.\"<ref>{{cite book\n | author= Ammonius\n | year= 1991\n | title= On Aristotle\'s Categories\n | location= Ithaca, NY\n | publisher= Cornell University Press\n | isbn= 0-8014-2688-X\n}} p. 15</ref>\n\nAnother common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant ? that all of Aristotle\'s extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (\'\'Fragments\'\' of some of Aristotle\'s dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle\'s writing style as \"a river of gold\";<ref>{{cite web\n | last =Cicero\n | first =Marcus Tullius\n | title =\'\'flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles\'\'\n | work =Academica Priora\n | date =106 BC ? 43 BC\n | url =http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/gutenberg/1/4/9/7/14970/14970-h/14970-h.htm#BkII_119\n | accessdate =25 January 2007}}</ref> it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us.<ref name=\"Barnes, Life and Work, p. 12\"/> However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero\'s praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle\'s extant works.<ref>Barnes, \"Roman Aristotle\", in Gregory Nagy, \'\'Greek Literature\'\', Routledge 2001, vol. 8, p. 174 n. 240.</ref>\n\nOne major question in the history of Aristotle\'s works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us<ref>.The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, \"Roman Aristotle\".</ref> The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his \'\'Geography\'\' and [[Plutarch]] in his \'\'[[Parallel Lives]]\'\'.<ref>\"Sulla.\"</ref> The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts\' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].<ref>Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar ? Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland</ref><ref>The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 ? Page 131, Grolier Incorporated ? Juvenile Nonfiction</ref>\n\nCarnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides \"the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Lord\n |first=Carnes\n |title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle\n |publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]\n |year=1984\n |location=Chicago\n |page=11\n}}</ref> Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon\'s inexpert attempt at repair.\n\nSecond, there is \"incontrovertible evidence,\" Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle\'s texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus\' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the \'\'[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]\'\', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.\n\nOn the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle\'s school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other \"exoteric\" texts]] which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle\'s school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.<ref>Anagnostopoulos, G., \"Aristotle\'s Works and Thoughts\", \'\'A Companion to Aristotle\'\' (Blackwell Publishing, 2009), p. 16.

He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Magee |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Magee |title=The Story of Philosophy |year=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page= 34}}</ref> Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],<ref>W.

[[Bertrand Russell]] notes that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell also refers to Aristotle\'s ethics as \"repulsive\", and calls his logic \"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\". Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.<ref name=\"philosophy1972\"/>\n\n===Later Greek philosophers===\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle\'s work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle\'s notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno (disambiguation)|Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle\'s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter\'s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle\'s geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men\'s common property?\"<ref>Plutarch, \'\'Life of Alexander\'\'</ref>\n\n===Influence on Byzantine scholars===\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were [[John Philoponus]], Elias, and David in the sixth century, and [[Stephen of Alexandria]] in the early seventh century.<ref>Richard Sorabji, ed. \'\'Aristotle Transformed\'\' London, 1990, 20, 28, 35?36.</ref> [[John Philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle\'s views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought.<ref>Richard Sorabji, ed. \'\'Aristotle Transformed\'\' (London, 1990) 233?274.</ref> After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and [[Michael of Ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[Anna Comnena]].<ref>Richard Sorabji, ed. \'\'Aristotle Transformed\'\' (London, 1990) 20?21; 28?29, 393?406; 407?408.</ref>\n\n===Influence on Islamic theologians===\nAristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early [[Islamic theology]]. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\'\'Encyclopedia of Islam\'\', \'\'Aristutalis\'\'</ref> as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by [[Muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. [[Alkindus]] considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy<ref>\'\'Rasa\'il\'\' I, 103, 17, Abu Rida</ref> and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future philosophers.<ref>\'\'Comm. Magnum\'\' in Aristotle\'\', \'\'De Anima\'\', III, 2, 43 Crawford</ref> Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\".<ref>\'\'al-mua\'llim al-thani\'\', \'\'Aristutalis\'\'</ref> The title \"teacher\" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[Islamic philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nasr|first=Seyyed Hossein|title=The Islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia|year=1996|publisher=Curzon Press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4|pages=59?60}}</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the [[Greeks|Greek]] theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with [[Plato]] essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Influence on Western Christian theologians===\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the \'\'Organon\'\' made by [[Boethius]]. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],<ref>{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}</ref> and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]].\n\nAfter [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke\'s translations, the demand for Aristotle\'s writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{SEP|aristotelianism-renaissance|Aristotelianism in the Renaissance}}</ref>\nAristotle is referred to as \"The Philosopher\" by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See \'\'[[Summa Theologica]]\'\', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\'\' at his beddes heed\'\'\n:\'\'Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,\'\'\n:\'\'Of aristotle and his philosophie,\'\'<ref>Geoffrey Chaucer, \'\'[[The Canterbury Tales]]\'\', Prologue, lines 295?295</ref>\nThe Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],\n:\'\'I saw the Master there of those who know,\'\'\n:\'\'Amid the philosophic family,\'\'\n:\'\'By all admired, and by all reverenced;\'\'\n:\'\'There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,\'\'\n:\'\'Who stood beside him closer than the rest.\'\'<ref>\'\'vidi \'l maestro di color che sanno\'\'\n\'\'seder tra filosofica famiglia.\'\'<br>\n\'\'Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno\'\':<br>\n\'\'quivi vid\'?o Socrate e Platone\'\'<br>\n\'\'che \'nnanzi a li altri pi? presso li stanno;\'\'<br> Dante, \'\'L\'Inferno\'\' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines 131?135</ref>\n\n===Post-Enlightenment thinkers===\nThe German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.<ref>Durant, p. 86</ref> However debatable this is, Aristotle rigid separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (\"natural [[slavery|slaves]]\"), and the natural superiority (virtue, \'\'arete\'\') of others. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as \"the greatest philosopher in history\" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.<ref>Kelvin Knight, \'\'Aristotelian Philosophy\'\', Polity Press, 2007, \'\'passim\'\'.</ref>\n\n==List of works==\n{{main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}\n\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle\'s lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle\'s school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]\'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (\'\'Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica\'\', Berlin, 1831?1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.\n\n==Eponyms==\n[[File:Aristotle - Jefferson Building - Library of Congress.jpg|thumb|250px|\"ARISTOTLE\" near the ceiling of the Great Hall in the [[Library of Congress]].]]\nThe [[Aristotle Mountains]] along the [[Oscar II Coast]] of [[Graham Land]], [[Antarctica]], are named after Aristotle.

Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.\n\nGershwin composed \'\'An American in Paris\'\' on commission from the conductor [[Walter Damrosch]]. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]]s, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition, which took place on December&nbsp;13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]], with Damrosch conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf</ref> Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work\'s premiere.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2983 | title = An American in Paris: About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author = Richard Freed | accessdate = 5 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nGershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: \"My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.\" When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], \"our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of [[homesickness]].\" But, \"nostalgia is not a fatal disease.\" The American visitor \"once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life\" and \"the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.\"\n\n==Background==\nGershwin was attracted by [[Maurice Ravel]]\'s unusual chords.  After transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether Ravel took students and how much he charged, Ravel looked at Gershwin\'s prior year earnings and sent a telegram to Gershwin jokingly saying he (Ravel) should study with Gershwin!...but he accepted him as a student.  Gershwin went to Paris in 1926 ready to study and to enjoy his first trip to Paris.  After his initial student audition with Ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, Ravel said he couldn\'t teach him but he would send a letter referring him to [[Nadia Boulanger]]. While the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of An American in Paris written as a \'thank you note\' to  Gershwin\'s hosts, Robert and Mabel Shirmer. Gershwin called it \"a rapsodic ballet\' written so freely and much more modern than his prior works.\n\nGershwin strongly encouraged Ravel to come to the United States for a tour, something Ravel had been reluctant to do.  To this end, upon his return to New York, Gershwin joined the efforts of Ravel\'s friend Robert Schmitz, a pianist Ravel had met during the War to urge Ravel to tour the U.S. Schmitz was the head of Pro Musica promoting Franco-American musical relations and was able to offer Ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement Gershwin knew would be important to Ravel.  \n  \nGershwin greeted Ravel in New York in February 1928 at the start of Ravel\'s U.S. Tour, and joined  Ravel again later in the tour in Los Angeles.  After a lunch together with Chaplin in Beverly Hills, Ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled \'house concert\' in a friend\'s music salon, performing among kindred spirits.\n\nRavel\'s tour reignited Gershwin\'s desire to return to Paris which he did in March 1928. Ravel\'s high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in Paris.  Yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him. Nadia Boulanger gave Gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students \"Don\'t copy others; be yourself.\" In this case \"Why try to be a second rate Ravel when you are already a first rate Gershwin?\"  This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his \'\'[[Rhapsody in Blue]]\'\'. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them [[Ezra Pound]], [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Ernest Hemingway]]; and artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. <ref>LSRI Archives Oral Interview Anita Loos and Mary Anita Loos October 1979 re: letters and Ravel\'s telegram to Gershwin</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nGershwin based \'\'An American in Paris\'\' on a melodic fragment called \"Very Parisienne\", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a \"rhapsodic ballet\" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in \'\'[[Musical America]]\'\', \"My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere.\"\n\nThe piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[Ternary form|ABA format]]. Gershwin\'s first A episode introduces the two main \"walking\" themes in the \"Allegretto grazioso\" and develops a third theme in the \"Subito con brio\". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Les Six]]. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section\'s \"Andante ma con ritmo deciso\" introduces the American [[Blues]] and spasms of homesickness. The \"Allegro\" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. \"Moderato con grazia\" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the \"walking\" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final ?Grandioso.?\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\'\'An American in Paris\'\' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[wood block]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as A, B, C and D, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and [[String section|strings]].\n\nThe revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.\n\n[[William Merrigan Daly|William Daly]] arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.\n\n==Response==\nGershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch\'s interpretation at the world premiere of \'\'An American in Paris\'\'. He stated that Damrosch\'s sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with \"a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses.\" Critics believed that \'\'An American in Paris\'\' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]]. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[C?sar Franck]], [[Richard Wagner]], or [[Guillaume Lekeu]] on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, \"It\'s not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It\'s a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It\'s not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds.\"\n\n==Preservation status==\n\nOn September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[Historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[University of Michigan]], are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin\'s true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin\'s composition process.<ref>http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/</ref>\n\nThe score to \'\'An American in Paris\'\' is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The entire project may take 30 to 40 years to complete, but \'\'An American in Paris\'\' will be an early volume in the series.<ref>http://www.music.umich.edu/ami/gershwin/?page_id=59</ref><ref>http://musicologynow.ams-net.org/2013/09/george-and-ira-gershwin-critical-edition_20.html</ref>\n\nTwo Urtext Editions of the work have been published by the german publisher B-Note Music in 2015. The changes made by Campbell-Watson have been withdrawn in both editions. In the extended Urtext, 120 bars of music have been re-integrated. Conductor Walter Damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.<ref>{{Internetquelle|titel=An American in Paris Urtext | url=https://www.bnote.de/?set=werk_detail&kompid=246&bnnr=16963&lc=en | format = HTML | zugriff=2015-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\n[[File:American in Paris.tif|thumb|First recording]]\n\'\'An American in Paris\'\' has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]]. Gershwin was on hand to \"supervise\" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September&nbsp;8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which \'\'An American in Paris,\'\' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The [[Seattle Symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of Gershwin\'s original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.<ref>http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&slug=1079541</ref>\n\n==Use in film==\nIn 1951, MGM released the musical \'\'[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]\'\', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the \'\'An American in Paris\'\' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[Johnny Green]]), costing $500,000.\n\nA part of the symphonic composition is also featured in \'\'[[As Good as It Gets]]\'\', released in 1997.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n* Rimler, Walter. \'\'George Gershwin&nbsp;?

The ceremony ran for 15&nbsp;minutes.\n\nWinners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\"/> This method was used until an occasion when the \'\'[[Los Angeles Times]]\'\' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n===Institutions===\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in \'\'[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]\'\' and \'\'[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]\'\'. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAt the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\n\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\nAll Academy Awards ceremonies always end with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] award.\n\n==Oscar statuette==\n\nAlthough there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], the [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]], the [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]], the [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]], the [[John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation]] and the [[Student Academy Award]]) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the \'\'Academy Award of Merit\'\' more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&nbsp;in (34.3&nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&nbsp;lb (3.856&nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader\'s]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes.

Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years.

Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor\'s Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. In 2010, the R.S. Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner. The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Oscar statues to include engraved names\n|author=Greg Kilday\n|date=February 9, 2010\n|publisher=Hollywood Reporter\n|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscar-statues-include-engraved-names-20476}}</ref><ref>{{citation\n|title=Governors Ball Secrets: Welcome to the \'Engraving Station,\' Where Oscar Statuettes Get Personalized \n|url=http://parade.com/266251/stevedaly/governors-ball-secrets-welcome-to-the-engraving-station-where-oscar-statuettes-get-personalized/\n|author=Steve Daly\n|date=February 28, 2014 \n|publisher=Parade Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===\nSince 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1.

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).\n\nThe Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher=Oscars.com| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090225132125/http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters |archivedate= 25 February 2009}}</ref> The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html |title=Nielsen ?

The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.\nThe Awards show was first televised in 1953, on [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.<ref>{{cite press release|url =http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20110224b.html|title= ABC and Academy Extend Oscar Telecast Agreement|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n|date= 24 February 2011|accessdate = 24 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330023546/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2011/20110224b.html|archivedate=2014-03-30}}</ref> The first countries to broadcast the Academy Awards on television, aside from the United States, were Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico; the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show, and Mexico did not carry the live event until 1964. By 1954, seven other countries, namely Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, were already broadcasting the Awards show, although previously filmed into a condensed 60-minute version, called the \"International Edition\" of the Academy Awards. The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event. By that time, the television rights to the Awards show were sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries. Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories, there was already available a previously filmed or taped 90-minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories. However, several Asian and Australasian countries, such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late 1970s. AMPAS still produces a condensed 90-minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive.\n\nAfter more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men\'s Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations\n|work=Los Angeles Times |author=Tom O\'Neil|date= 12 July 2010|accessdate = 13 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html| archivedate= 19 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/6:00 p.m [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&nbsp;pm Pacific.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185231/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|archivedate=2014-03-04}}</ref> The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19980701&id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle ? 1 July 1998; From \'\'Google News Archive\'\'</ref> For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19990319&id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item ? 19 March 1999.

Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.\n\n==Operation==\n\nTAI as a time scale is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.badw.de/fileadmin/IAG-docs/Travaux2013/08_BIPM.pdf |title=Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)  Time Department  | publisher=Report of the International Association of Geodesy 2011-2013 |date= |accessdate=19 January 2015}}</ref> in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.{{sfn|Time|n.d.}} The clocks are compared using [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].<ref>Circular T 2009.</ref>  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see [[signal averaging]] for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are [[Atomic clock|caesium clocks]]; the definition of the [[International System of Units|SI]] [[second]] is written in terms of [[caesium]].<ref>McCarthy &Seidelmann 2009, 207, 214</ref>\n\nThe participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds.  These time scales are denoted in the form \'\'UTC(NPL)\'\' in the UTC form, where \'\'NPL\'\' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].  The TAI form may be denoted \'\'TAI(NPL)\'\'.  The latter is not to be confused with \'\'TA(NPL)\'\', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.\n\nThe clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.<ref>\"Time\" n.d.</ref>  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[Canonical form|canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(\'\'k\'\') (equivalent to TAI-TAI(\'\'k\'\')) for each participating institution \'\'k\'\'.  (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA(\'\'k\'\'), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)\n\nErrors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).\n\n==History==\nEarly atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL)]]. The \"Greenwich Atomic\" (GA) scale began in 1955 at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T<sub>m</sub> or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, [[Boulder, Colorado]].   Both the BIH scale and A.1 were defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: \"A3\" in 1963 and \"TA(BIH)\" in 1969.<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann 2009, 199&ndash;201.</ref>  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.\n\nThe SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds.<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann 2009, 202&ndash;4.</ref> During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.<ref>William Markowitz. \"Nondependence of Frequency on Mass: A Differential Experiment\" [[doi:10.1126/science.162.3860.1387]]</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name \'\'EAL\'\' (\'\'Echelle Atomique Libre\'\', meaning \'\'Free Atomic Scale\'\').<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann, 215.</ref>\n\nThe instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.<ref>Brumberg V.A. & Kopeikin S.M., \"Relativistic time scales in the solar system\", Cel. Mech. Dyn. Astron., Vol. 48, pp. 23 - 44, 1990 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990CeMDA..48...23B</ref>  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&nbsp;s.<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann, 218&ndash;9.</ref>\n\nThe continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated \"In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC.\"<ref>*{{cite web\n|title=CCTF 09-27\n|url=http://www.bipm.org/cc/CCTF/Allowed/18/CCTF_09-27_note_on_UTC-ITU-R.pdf\n|date=3 September 2007\n|publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated [[UT2]] until the end of 1971, and [[UT1]] thereafter.  This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH\'s atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.<ref>McCarthy & Seidelmann 2009, 227&ndash;9.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Time and frequency transfer]]\n* [[Clock synchronization]]\n* [[Network Time Protocol]]\n* [[Precision Time Protocol]], a related though separate technology\n* [[Magneto-optical trap]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web\n|title=International Atomic Time\n|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html\n|date=2013\n|publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures}}\n*{{cite web\n|url=ftp://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/tai-utc.dat\n|title=History of TAI?UTC\n|publisher=Time Service Dept., United States Naval Observatory\n|date=2009\n|accessdate=4 January 2010}}\n*{{cite web | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/tai.html | title = International Atomic Time | accessdate =22 February 2013 | publisher = [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]}}\n*{{Cite book\n|authorlink1=Dennis McCarthy (scientist)\n|last1=McCarthy\n|first1=D.

It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of \"others\" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of [[selfishness]]. The word was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as \'\'altruisme\'\', for an [[antonym]] of egoism.<ref>{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=19 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&dq}}</ref> He derived it from the Italian \'\'altrui\'\', which in turn was derived from Latin \'\'alteri\'\', meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&dq}}</ref>\n\nAltruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\".<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees 2010, Vol.19(2), pp.249-57|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether \'\'\"true\"\'\' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an [[intrinsic]] reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as \"benefits\". The actor also may not be expecting a reward.\n\nThe term \'\'[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]\'\' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which is defined as acting to the benefit of one\'s self.\n\n==The notion of altruism==\nThe concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.\n\n==Scientific viewpoints<!--linked from \'Evolution of morality\'-->==\n\n===Anthropology===\n[[Marcel Mauss]]\'s book \'\'The Gift\'\' contains a passage: \"Note on alms.\" This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:\n\n<blockquote>Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.</blockquote>\n\n* Compare [[altruism (ethics)|Altruism (ethics) ? perception of altruism as self-sacrifice]].\n* Compare [[alms|explanation of alms in various scriptures]].\n\n===Evolutionary explanations===\n{{Main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}\n[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|Giving alms to beggar children]]\nIn the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.<ref name=\"Bell2008\">{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367?368 }}</ref> In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].<ref name=\"AEP1\">Pat Barcaly.

Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.\n\nSome of the proposed mechanisms are:\n* [[Kin selection]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helping behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.<ref name=AEP1/>\n* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.<ref name=AEP1/>\n* [[Reciprocal altruism]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35?57}}</ref> See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].\n** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390?1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A}}</ref> Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n::One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a \"Community Game\" instead of a \"Wall Street Game.\"<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n::A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n::People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population.

This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one\'s resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n[[File:FEMA - 15337 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-10-2005 in Texas.jpg|thumb|Volunteers assist Hurricane victims at the [[Houston Astrodome]], following Hurricane Katrina.]]\n:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.<ref name=AEP1/> Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic.

When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.<ref name=AEP1/><ref name=AEP2/>\n\n:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\n:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.<ref name=AEP1/>\n* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.<ref>Leon Neyfakh\nWhere does good come from?, 17 April 2011, http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/04/17/where_does_good_come_from/</ref><ref>E.

Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\nEvery single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\nThe benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.<ref name=AEP1/>\n\nThe study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]\'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as \'\'[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.\'\' These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.\n\nSelective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01|last1=Brown|first1=S.L.|last2=Brown|first2=R.M.|year=2006|title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships|url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Psychological Inquiry|volume=17|pages=1?29}}</ref><ref>http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/Talk/Document/StLouis2011TelmoFIN.pdf</ref>\n\nSuch cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book \'\'[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]\'\' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book \'\'[[A Darwinian Left]].\'\'\n\n====Initial evolutionary problematics====\nThere are problems of early stage evolution of altruism.

However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region.

These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being\" (Dalai Lama).<ref name=\"Speech by the Dalai Lama\">[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama]<br>The phrase \"core of our being\" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von W?lfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud\'s \'Core of our Being\' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226?244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}</ref>\n\nSince \"all beings\" includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as \"altruistic.\" Many would agree with the [[Dalai Lama]] that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.\n\nStill, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: \"The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes\" (Dalai Lama<ref name=\"Speech by the Dalai Lama\"/>).\n\nIn the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.\n\n{{Main|Karma in Buddhism}}\nIn Buddhism, \'\'karma\'\' (P?li \'\'kamma\'\') is strictly distinguished from \'\'\'\'\'[[vipaka|vip?ka]]\'\'\'\'\', meaning \"fruit\" or \"result\". Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (P?li \'\'hetu\'\') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of \"volitional activities\" (Pali \'\'sankhara\'\') and \"action\" (Pali \'\'bhava\'\'). Any action is understood to create \"seeds\" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (P?li \'\'vipaka\'\') when they meet the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|sams?ra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirv?na]].\n\nBuddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between \"good\" and \"bad\", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be \"bad\" in that it creates unpleasant results for the \"actor.\"\n\nIn Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:<ref>{{cite book| last = Davids| first = Rhys| title = Buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C&pg=PA119| year = 2007| publisher = Lightning Source Incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Padmasiri de Silva| title = Environmental Philosophy and Ethics in Buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC&pg=PA41| year = 1998| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }}</ref>\n\n* Kamma Niyama ?

Nature\'s tendency to produce a perfect type\n\n===Jainism===\n{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}\n[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of \'\'ahimsa\'\' (non-injury)]]\nThe fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of \'\'[[Ahimsa]]\'\' ? to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]] introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.\n\nJainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One\'s unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.\n\nJains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:\n# Non-violence (Ahimsa);\n# Truthfulness (Satya);\n# Non-stealing (Asteya);\n# Celibacy (Brahmacharya);\n# [[Non-possession]] or non-materialism (Aparigraha);\nThe \"great vows\" ([[Mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and \"limited vows\" ([[Anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.\n\nThe principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become \'\'Siddha\'\' ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one\'s actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]\nAltruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of \"disinterested love\", as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase \"love seeks not its own interests.\" In his book \'\'Indoctrination and Self-deception,\'\' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person\'s experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.\n\n[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets \'You should love your neighbour as yourself\'<ref>[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22</ref> as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.<ref>\'\'[[Summa Theologica]]\'\', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4</ref> Considering that \"the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship\" and quotes Aristotle that \"the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,\"<ref>[[Nichomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1</ref> he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life?since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.\n\nMany biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one\'s fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other\'s good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one\'s own good when the other\'s demands undermine overall well-being.\n\nGerman philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, \"motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one?s own life and existence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88?89}}</ref> Another way is merely \"one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people?s business.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95?96}}</ref> At its worst, Scheler says, \"love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96?97}}</ref>\n\n===Islam===\nIn [[Islam]], the concept \'?th?r\' (?????) (altruism) is the notion of \'preferring others to oneself\'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one\'s own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing ?th?r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.<ref>{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10?11 }}</ref>\nThis is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i\'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[Allah]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.<ref name=\"Neusner2005\">{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79?80 }}</ref>\nThis concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[Allah]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as \"Yarat?lan? severiz, Yaratandan ?t?r?\" or \'\'We love the creature, because of The Creator.\'\' For many Muslims, i\'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i\'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.\n\n===Judaism===\nJudaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.<ref>{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135?136}}</ref> This is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the \'purpose of creation\' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.<ref>{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe ?ayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37?38}}</ref>\n\nModern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120?130 }}</ref> Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another.

The ninth Guru\n, Guru Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield.\n\"What were you doing, and why?\" asked the Guru. \"I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,\" replied Bhai Kanhaiya.\nThe Guru responded, \"Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.\"\n\nIt was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.<ref>{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}</ref>\n\n===Hinduism===\n[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one\'s merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.<ref>Sivananda, Swami. \'\'Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8\'\', Sutras 38?41.</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}\n\nThere exists a wide range of philosophical views on man\'s obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.\n\nA related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one\'s self-interest (without specifying how this affects one\'s moral obligations).\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|2|\n* [[Altruria, California|Altruria]]\n* [[Charity (practice)]]\n* [[Charitable organization]]\n* [[Comedy of the commons]]\n* [[Cool To Be Kind]]\n* [[Effective altruism]]\n* [[Egotism]]\n* [[Empathy]]\n* [[Empathy-altruism]]\n* [[Family economics]]\n* [[Gene-centered view of evolution]]\n* [[Giving Pledge]], pledge by Gates, Buffett and others to donate to charity at least half of their wealth\n* [[Inclusive fitness]]\n* [[Group selection]]\n* [[Kin selection]]\n* [[Misanthropy]]\n* [[Mutual aid (organization)|Mutual aid]]\n* [[Philanthropy]]\n* \'\'[[The Power of Half]]\'\'; how a family came to decide to sell its home, so that it could donate half the proceeds to charity\n* [[Prisoner\'s dilemma]]\n* [[Prosocial behavior]]\n* [[Random act of kindness]]\n* [[Reciprocal altruism]]\n* [[Selfishness]]\n* [[Social psychology]]\n* [[Solidarity (sociology)]]\n* [[Tit for tat]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book| last = Oord| first = Thomas| title = The Altruism Reader| year = 2007| publisher = Templeton Foundation Press| location = Philadelphia| isbn = 978-1-59947-127-3 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Oord| first = Thomas| title = Defining Love| year = 2010| publisher = Brazos Press| location = Grand Rapids| isbn = 1-58743-257-9 }}\n* {{cite book| last = Batson| first = Charles| title = The Altruism Question| year = 1991| publisher = L.

In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the \n[[Baum?Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].

His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883-1964), became a physician. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.<ref name=\"Kevin Brownlow 1968\">{{cite book |author=Brownlow, Kevin |title=The Parade\'s Gone By . . . |publisher=Ballantine Books, Inc. |location=New York |year=1969 |page=111 }}</ref> At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Career==\nDwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12?13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}</ref> Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].\n\nAfter making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 \'\'[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]\'\'. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 \"Lambs\' Gambol\" for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in \'\'[[Heidi]]\'\' (1937) and \'\'[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]\'\' (1938).\n\nDwan helped launch the career of two other very successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct \'\'[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]\'\' and \'\'[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]\'\', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, \'\'[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]\'\'. He directed his last movie in 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&retailCheck=&Type=PN&CatID=DATABIN_DIRECTOR&ID=11207&AN_ID=&searchedFor=Allan_Dwan_ |

In memoirs, some French officers have described torture of Algerians during the war.

This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC.

These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.\n\nAs Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.\n\n[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]\n\nBy the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage\'s North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nIn 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern-day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.\n\nAfter Masinissa\'s death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa\'s line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n[[File:GM Massinissa.png|upright|thumbnail|left|Berber King [[Masinissa]]]]\n\nFor several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was the bishop of [[Hippo Regius]] (modern-day Algeria), located in the Roman province of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].

After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]] and the [[Fatimids]].\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, North Africa was home to many great Scholars, Saints and Sovereigns including [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah Ibn Quraysh]] the first grammarian to suggest the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family, the great Sufi masters [[Abu Madyan|Sidi Boumediene (Abu Madyan)]] and [[Sidi El Houari]], as well as the Emirs [[Abd al-Mu\'min|Abd Al Mu\'min]] and [[Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan|Y?ghm?rasen]]. It was during this time period that the [[Fatimids]] or children of Fatima, daughter of Muhammad, came to the Maghreb. These \"Fatimids\" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz, and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, primarily made of [[Arabs]] and [[levant]]ians extending from Algeria to their capital state of [[Cairo]]. The [[Fatimid caliphate]] began to collapse when its governors the [[Zirids]] seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the [[Arab]] [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic [[Taghribat Bani Hilal|T?ghrib?t]]. In Al-T?ghr?b?t the Amazigh Zirid Hero [[Khalifa al-Zanati|Kh?l?f? Al-Z?nat?]] asks daily, for duels, to defeat the Hilalan hero [[Abu Zayd al-Hilali|?bu Zayd al-Hilal?]] and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The [[Zirid]]s however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of Arab customs and culture. The indigenous [[Berber people|Amazigh]] tribes however remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location, and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as [[Fatimid Caliphate]] made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], the [[Red Sea]] coast of Africa, Tihamah, [[Hejaz]], and [[Yemen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202580/Fatimid-Dynasty/2238/Conquest-of-Egypt|title=Fatimid Dynasty (Islamic dynasty)|publisher=Encyclop?dia Britannica|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_carte.php?carte=carte-05 |title=Qantara |publisher=Qantara-med.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=595 |title=Qantara ?

The two main branches were the Botr and Barn?s tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]], Kutama, Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR2|title=Histoire des Berb?res et des dynasties musulmanes de l\'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khald?n, William MacGuckin Slane| trans_title =History of the Berbers and the Muslim dynasties of northern Africa | language= French |page=XV|author=Khald?n, Ibn|year=1852}}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Berber people|Amazigh]] dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands.

Spain took control of few coastal towns like [[Mers el Kebir]] in 1505; [[Oran]] in 1509; and [[Tlemcen]], [[Mostaganem]], and [[T?n?s]], in 1510. In the same year, few merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain\'s merchant fleet.<ref>{{cite web|title=European Offensive|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/14.htm|publisher=Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n===Arabization===\n{{Main|Banu Hilal}}Reigned in [[Ifriqiya]], current Tunisia, a [[Berbers|Berber]] family, [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]], somehow recognizing the suzerainty of the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph of [[Cairo]]. Probably in 1048, the Zirid ruler or viceroy, el-Mu\'izz, decided to end this suzerainty. The [[Fatimid]] state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition; The Viceroy, el-Mu\'izz, also found another means of revenge.\n\nBetween the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] were living [[Bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[Arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[Nile Valley]] since the nomads would often loot. The then [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[Maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. This not only prompted the Bedouins to leave, but the [[Fatimid]]treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.\n\nWhole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. Some stopped on the way, especially in [[Cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[Ifriqiya]] by the [[Gab?s Governorate|Gabe]]s region. The [[Zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but each meeting, the last under the walls of [[Kairouan]], his troops were defeated and [[Arabs]] remained masters of the field.\n\nThe flood was still rising and in 1057, the [[Arabs]] spread on the high plains of [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] where they gradually choked [[Beni Hammad Fort|Qalaa of Banu Hammad]], as they had done Kairouan few decades ago. From there, they gradually gained the upper [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]] plains, some were forcibly taken by the [[Almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. We can say that in the 13th century there were in all of [[North Africa]], with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely [[Berbers|Berber]].\n\n===Ottoman Algeria===\n{{main|Ottoman Algeria}}\n[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]]]\n[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|Old [[Algiers]] in the 16th century, with the [[Spain|Spanish]]-built [[Pe??n of Algiers]] in the forefront]]\nThe region of Algeria was partially ruled by [[Ottomans]] for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. In 1516 the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[Hafsids]], moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in conquering Jijel and Algiers from the [[Spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the \'\'Bani Ziyad\'\' dynasty, to flee.<ref>[[Hayreddin Barbarossa#Rulers of Algiers]]</ref> When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[Kingdom of Tlemcen|Tlemcen]], Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin conquered the whole area between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\nThe next beylerbey was Hayreddin\'s son [[Hasan Pasha (son of Barbarossa)|Hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\n[[Plague (disease)|Plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620?21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654?57, 1665, 1691, and 1740?42.<ref name=\"Davis\" />\n\nIn 1671, the [[taifa]] rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of [[dey]]. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the [[divan]], a council of some sixty nobles. It was at first dominated by the \'\'[[ojaq]]\'\'; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey\'s instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"csa16\" />\n\nThe dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671?1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of Ottomon government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency\'s authority was seldom applied in the [[Kabylie]].<ref name=\"csa16\">{{cite web|title=Algeria&nbsp;?

This period had also known [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Nonius Marcellus]] and [[Martianus Capella]], among many others. The Middle Ages have known many Arabic writers who revolutionized the Arab world literature, with authors like [[Ahmad al-Buni]], [[Ibn Manzur]] and [[Ibn Khaldoun]], who wrote the [[Muqaddimah]] while staying in Algeria, and many others.\n\n[[Albert Camus]] was an Algerian-born French Pied-Noir author. In 1957 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]].\n\n{{double image|right|Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, from \'Crabbes Historical Dictionary\', published in 1825 (C19).jpg|120|Kateb Yacine Nedjma authograph.jpg|120|[[Apuleius]]|[[Kateb Yacine]]}}\n\nToday Algeria contains, in its literary landscape, big names having not only marked the Algerian literature, but also the universal literary heritage in Arabic and French.\n\nAs a first step, Algerian literature was marked by works whose main concern was the assertion of the Algerian national entity, there is the publication of novels as the \'\'Algerian trilogy\'\' of [[Mohammed Dib]], or even \'\'Nedjma\'\' of [[Kateb Yacine]] novel which is often regarded as a monumental and major work. Other known writers will contribute to the emergence of Algerian literature whom include [[Mouloud Feraoun]], [[Malek Bennabi]], [[Malek Haddad]], [[Moufdi Zakaria]], [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]], Mohamed La?d Al-Khalifa, [[Mouloud Mammeri]], [[Frantz Fanon]], and [[Assia Djebar]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the independence, several new authors emerged on the Algerian literary scene, they will attempt through their works to expose a number of social problems, among them there are [[Rachid Boudjedra]], [[Rachid Mimouni]], [[Leila Sebbar]], [[Tahar Djaout]] and [[Tahir Wattar]].\n\nCurrently, a part of Algerian writers tends to be defined in a literature of shocking expression, due to the terrorism that occurred during the 1990s, the other party is defined in a different style of literature who staged an individualistic conception of the human adventure. Among the most noted recent works, there is the writer, \'\'the swallows of Kabul\'\' and \'\'the attack\'\' of [[Yasmina Khadra]], \'\'the oath of barbarians\'\' of [[Boualem Sansal]], \'\'memory of the flesh\'\' of [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] and the last novel by Assia Djebar \'\'nowhere in my father\'s House\'\'.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main| Music of Algeria}}\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Dahman harrachi.jpg|upright|thumbnail|left|[[Dahmane El Harrachi]]]] -->\n[[Chaabi (Algeria)|Cha?bi music]] is a typically Algerian musical genre characterized by specific rhythms and of Qacidate (Popular poems) in Arabic dialect.

Rahaba music style is unique to the Aures. [[Souad Massi]] is a rising Algerian folk singer. Other Algerian singers of the diaspora include [[Manel Filali]] in Germany and [[Kenza Farah]] in France. Tergui music is sung in [[Tuareg languages]] generally, [[Tinariwen]] had a worldwide success. Finally, the sta?fi music is born in [[S?tif]] and remains a unique style of its kind.\n\nModern music is available in several facets, [[Ra?]] music is a style typical of Western Algeria.

The cuisine uses cereals as the main products, since they are always produced with abundance in the country.

However, traditional cakes are also made at home, following the habits and customs of each family. Among these cakes, there are Tamina, Chrik, Garn logzelles, Griouech, Kalb el-louz, Makroud, Mbardja, Mchewek, Samsa, Tcharak, Baghrir, Khfaf, Zlabia, Aarayech, Ghroubiya and Mghergchette. Algerian pastry also contains Tunisian or French cakes. Marketed and home-made bread products include varieties such as Kessra or Khmira or Harchaya, chopsticks and so-called washers Khoubz dar or Matloue.\nOther tradionel meals (Chakhchokha-Hassoua-T\'chicha-Mahjouba and Doubara) are famous in Biskra.\n\n==Health==\n{{Main|Health in Algeria}}\nIn 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to \"improved water sources\" was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to \"improved sanitation\". According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of \"reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015\". Given Algeria\'s young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies ?

She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. Given James\' incompetence, Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.\n\n====Francisco d\'Anconia====\nFrancisco d\'Anconia is one of the central characters in \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\', an owner by inheritance of the world\'s largest [[copper]] mining operation. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart. A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the \"climax\" of the d\'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskj?ld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family\'s wealth and power. Later, Francisco bankrupts the d\'Anconia business to put it out of others\' reach. His full name is given as \"Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebasti?n d\'Anconia\".<ref>The accent in the given name \'\'Sebasti?n\'\' is in accordance with [[Spanish orthography]]; however, the same rule would require writing \'\'Andr?s\'\'.</ref>\n\n====John Galt====\n{{Main|John Galt}}\nJohn Galt is the primary male hero of \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\'. He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees\' cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie\'s side of their conversations is given in the novel. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker\'s true identity.\n\nBefore working for Taggart Transcontinental, Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden. Galt himself remains concealed, throughout much of the novel, in a valley concealed by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. Much of the book\'s third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the author\'s philosophy of Objectivism.\n\n====Henry \"Hank\" Rearden====\nHenry (known as \"Hank\") Rearden is one of the central characters in \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\'. He owns the most important steel company in the United States, and invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother. Rearden represents a type of [[self-made man]] or prototypical hero, and illustrates Rand\'s [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]] in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to Dagny Taggart.\n\n====Eddie Willers====\nEdwin \"Eddie\" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and himself likewise. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt\'s associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt, Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.\n\n====Ragnar Danneskj?ld====\nOne of Galt\'s first followers, and world famous as a [[pirate]], who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People\'s States of Europe. He works to  ensure that once those espousing Galt\'s philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskj?ld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. Danneskj?ld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a retired [[film star]]. Considered a misfit by Galt\'s other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt\'s perspective.\n\nAccording to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskj?ld\'s adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.<ref>Reedstrom, Karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 Interview with Full Context]. Barbara Branden interview in \'\'Full Context\'\', October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.</ref> In a 1974 comment at a lecture, Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskj?ld\'s name was a tribute to Victor Hugo\'s novel, \'\'Hans of Iceland\'\', wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskj?ld. In the published book, Danneskj?ld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.\n\n===Antagonists===\n\n====James Taggart====\nThe President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book\'s most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.\n\n====Lillian Rearden====\nThe unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value. Lillian achieves this, when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband\'s affair with his sister. This information is used to persuade Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others. Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction, until Hank abandons her.\n\n====Dr. Floyd Ferris====\n\nFerris is a biologist who works as \"co-ordinator\" at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled \'\'Why Do You Think You Think?\'\' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.\n\n====Dr. Robert Stadler====\nA former professor at Patrick Henry University, and along with colleague Hugh Akston, mentor to Francisco d\'Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskj?ld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X (Xylophone). The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].<ref>David Harriman, \'\'[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]\'\', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.</ref> To his former student Galt, Stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the \"man who knew better\" but chose not to act for the good.\n\n====Wesley Mouch====\nThe incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces Hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources. Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country.\n\n==Secondary characters==\nThe following secondary characters also appear in the novel.<ref>Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for \"major.\" Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.</ref>\n\n*\'\'\'Hugh Akston\'\'\' is identified as \"One of the last great advocates of reason.\" He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d\'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskj?ld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston\'s name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental. He is based on [[Aristotle]].\n*\'\'\'Jeff Allen\'\'\' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny\'s cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company (Rand\'s extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of John Galt\'s true background.\n*\'\'\'Calvin Atwood\'\'\' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galt\'s strike.\n*\'\'\'Mayor Bascom\'\'\' is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.\n*\'\'\'Dr. Blodgett\'\'\' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.\n*\'\'\'Orren Boyle\'\'\' is the head of Associated Steel, antithesis of Hank Rearden and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebasti?n Mines. He disappears from the story after having a nervous breakdown following the failed \'unification\' of the steel industry.\n*\'\'\'Laura Bradford\'\'\' is an actress and Kip Chalmers\'s mistress.\n*\'\'\'Bill Brent\'\'\' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.\n*\'\'\'Cherryl Brooks\'\'\' is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success. She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart\'s descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. She eventually commits suicide, unable to live with her worthless husband, and unable to escape.\n*\'\'\'Millie Bush\'\'\' was \"a mean, ugly little eight-year-old\" girl voted to receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the Marxist \"family\" committee who determined how pay was allocated at The Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her teeth are later knocked out by a man denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he valued.\n*\'\'\'Emma Chalmers\'\'\', Kip Chalmers\' mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as \"Kip\'s Ma,\" she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year\'s wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.\n*\'\'\'Kip Chalmers\'\'\' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.\n*\'\'\'Dan Conway\'\'\' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.\n*\'\'\'Ken Danagger\'\'\' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt\'s strike moments before Dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise.\n*\'\'\'Quentin Daniels\'\'\' is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt\'s motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny\'s pursuit of Quentin leads her to Galt\'s Gulch.\n*\'\'\'Sebastian d\'Anconia\'\'\' was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d\'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from Spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[Inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d\'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.\n*\'\'\'Balph Eubank\'\'\' is called \"the literary leader of the age\", despite the fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to 10,000 copies. He is a [[misogynist]] who thinks it disgusting that Dagny Taggart is a railroad vice-president.\n*The \'\'\'Fishwife\'\'\' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond?s grocery market; she is described as having \"dark, disheveled hair and large eyes\", and is a writer. Galt says she \"wouldn\'t be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.\" According to Barbara Branden in her book \'\'[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]\'\', \"The [[Fishwife]] is Ayn\'s [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock-like]] appearance in \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\'.\"<ref name=\"Branden1986\">{{cite book|author=Barbara Branden|title=The passion of Ayn Rand|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B-AEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2010|date=20 May 1986|publisher=Doubleday|page=229}}</ref> So says too Leonard Peikoff.<ref>{{cite web|author=Leonard Peikoff |url=http://www.peikoff.com/2012/09/10/in-atlas-shrugged-when-john-is-giving-dagny-the-tour |title=In Atlas Shrugged, when John is giving Dagny the tour of the valley, there is a character briefly introduced who is identified as a writer and who matches Ayn Rand?s physical description.

He eventually quits and joins the strike.\n*\'\'\'Richard Halley\'\'\' is Dagny Taggart\'s favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera \'\'[[Phaethon]]\'\' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, \'\'Phaethon\'\' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. It is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt\'s Gulch.\n*\'\'\'Mrs. William Hastings\'\'\' is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.\n*\'\'\'Dr. Thomas Hendricks\'\'\' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt\'s strike when the American medical system was put under government control.\n*\'\'\'Tinky Holloway\'\'\' is one of the \"looters\" and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.\n*\'\'\'Lee Hunsacker\'\'\' is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike. A failed businessman, he laments constantly that no-one ever gave him a chance.\n*\'\'\'Gwen Ives\'\'\' is Hank Rearden\'s secretary.\n*\'\'\'Owen Kellogg\'\'\' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York. He catches Dagny Taggart\'s eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt\'s Gulch.\n*\'\'\'Gilbert Keith-Worthing\'\'\' is a British novelist of erstwhile fame, now neglected but still considered a \"walking classic\". Rand introduces him only for a few pages as a guest of Kip Chalmers (\"for no reason that either of them could discover\") to then implicitly have him asphyxiated in the Tunnel catastrophe, after giving some statements.\n*\'\'\'Fred Kinnan\'\'\' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt\'s three-hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.\n*\'\'\'Paul Larkin\'\'\' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.\n*\'\'\'Eugene Lawson\'\'\' heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it his bank goes bankrupt. One of the looter\'s cabal, he is a collectivist who abhors production and money-making.\n*\'\'\'Mort Liddy\'\'\' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden\'s friends and a member of the cultural elite.\n*\'\'\'Clifton Locey\'\'\' is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.\n*\'\'\'Pat Logan\'\'\' is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He later strikes.\n*\'\'\'Kay Ludlow\'\'\' is a beautiful actress and the wife of Ragnar Danneskj?ld.\n*\'\'\'Dick McNamara\'\'\' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt\'s Gulch.\n*\'\'\'Cuffy Meigs\'\'\' is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit\'s foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as \"impervious to thought\". Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country\'s last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.\n*\'\'\'Dave Mitchum\'\'\' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.\n*\'\'\'Chick Morrison\'\'\' holds the position of \"Morale Conditioner\" in the government. He quits when society begins to collapse and flees to a stronghold in Tennessee. His fellow looters consider it unlikely that he will survive.\n*\'\'\'Horace Bussby Mowen\'\'\' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.\n*\'\'\'Midas Mulligan\'\'\' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt\'s strike. He is the legal owner of the land where Galt\'s Gulch is located. Mulligan\'s birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him \"[[Midas]]\" in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.\n*\'\'\'Judge Narragansett\'\'\' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett\'s ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[United States Constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.\n*\'\'\'Ben Nealy\'\'\' is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.\n*\'\'\'Ted Nielsen\'\'\' is the head of Nielsen Motors. He eventually goes on strike, along with most of the other industrialist \"producer\" types, by closing his motor factory. Dagny later finds him when she visits Galt\'s Gulch for the first time.\n*\'\'\'Betty Pope\'\'\' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.\n*\'\'\'Dr. Potter\'\'\' holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.\n*\'\'\'Dr. Simon Pritchett\'\'\' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.\n*\'\'\'Rearden\'s mother\'\'\', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.\n*\'\'\'Philip Rearden\'\'\' is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother\'s home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother\'s charity.\n*\'\'\'Dwight Sanders\'\'\' owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.\n*\'\'\'Bertram Scudder\'\'\' is an editorial writer for the magazine \'\'The Future\'\'. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called \'\'The Octopus\'\'. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Scudder claims that the most important thing in life is \"brother love\" but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him. He loses his job after Dagny Taggart reveals her affair with Hank Rearden over air on his radio show.\n*\'\'\'Claude Slagenhop\'\'\' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden\'s friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.\n*\'\'\'Gerald and Ivy Starnes\'\'\' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes, the founder of the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father\'s company was entirely due to the workers. Eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved. He committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man. Gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish parties using company funds. Ivy, on the other hand, is described as a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no desire for wealth of her own.\n*\'\'\'Andrew Stockton\'\'\' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt\'s Gulch.\n*\'\'\'Nathaniel \"Nat\" Taggart\'\'\' was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to Francisco when she is ready to join Galt\'s strike.  It is suspected that he is modeled after James Jerome Hill, builder or the Great Northern Railroad. \n*\'\'\'Mr. Thompson\'\'\' is the \"[[Head of State|Head of the State]]\" for the United States. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand\'s notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him \"President of the United States\" as this title has \"honorable connotations\" which the character does not deserve.\n*\'\'\'Lester Tuck\'\'\' is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.\n*\'\'\'Clem Weatherby\'\'\' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. She notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses.\n*The \'\'\'Wet Nurse (Tony)\'\'\' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden?s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters? code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.\n*\'\'\'Ellis Wyatt\'\'\' is the head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother\'s policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: \"I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It\'s yours.\" One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as \"Wyatt\'s Torch\". Later Dagny meets him in Galt\'s Gulch.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Companies in Atlas Shrugged]]\n*[http://www.atlaslisted.com Website with comprehensive list of individuals mentioned in Atlas Shrugged]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |title=The New Ayn Rand Companion |last=Gladstein |first=Mimi Reisel |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-313-30321-5 |oclc=40359365}}\n*{{cite book |title=Essays on Ayn Rand\'s Atlas Shrugged |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7391-2779-7}}\n*{{cite book|title=Atlas Shrugged | last1=Rand | first1=Ayn | last2=Peikoff | first2=Leonard | location=University of Michigan | publisher=Dutton | year=1992 | isbn=0-525-93418-9}}\n*{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand\'s Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion |editor-last=Younkins |editor-first=Edward W. |location=Burlington, Vermont |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=0-7546-5533-4}}\n\n{{Atlas Shrugged}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atlas Shrugged Characters, List of}}\n[[Category:Atlas Shrugged characters| ]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]'	'Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/Joejfjnfjnrngjvnrj|Joejfjnfjnrngjvnrj]] ([[User talk:Joejfjnfjnrngjvnrj|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG'	21857263	'KH-1'	'20151216034006'	''	0	0	1	RAND()	DATE_ADD('1970-01-01', INTERVAL UNIX_TIMESTAMP() SECOND)+0	'79848783965993'

Various short-lived organizations  of anthropologists had already been formed. The [[Soci?t? Ethnologique de Paris]], the first to use [[Ethnology]], was formed in 1839. Its members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was abolished in France in 1848 the Soci?t? was abandoned.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the [[American Ethnological Society]], was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the [[Ethnological Society of London]] in 1843, a break-away group of the [[Aborigines\' Protection Society]].<ref name=Schiller131>{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|pp=130?132}}</ref> These anthropologists of the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-human-rights activists. They maintained international connections.\n\nAnthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century. Theorists in such diverse fields as [[comparative anatomy|anatomy]], [[Comparative method (linguistics)|linguistics]], and  [[Ethnology]], making  feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.<ref>{{harvnb|Schiller|1979|p=221}}</ref> For them, the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]\'s \'\'[[On the Origin of Species]]\'\' was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in [[agronomy]] and in the wild.\n\nDarwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. [[Paul Broca]] in Paris was in the process of breaking away from the  [[Soci?t? de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Soci?t? d\'Anthropologie de Paris]], meeting for the first time in Paris in 1859.<ref name=Fletcher>{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Fletcher | chapter=Paul Broca and the French School of Anthropology | title=The Saturday Lectures, Delivered in the Lecture-room of the U.

He wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[Broca\'s area]] after him. His interest was mainly in [[Biological anthropology]], but a German philosopher specializing in psychology, [[Theodor Waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled \'\'Die Anthropologie der Naturv?lker\'\', 1859?1864. The title was soon translated as \"The Anthropology of Primitive Peoples\".  The last two volumes were published posthumously.\n\nWaitz defined anthropology as \"the science of the nature of man\". By nature he meant matter animated by \"the Divine breath\";<ref>{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=1}}</ref> i.e., he was an [[Animism|animist]]. Following Broca\'s lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from \"the animals nearest to him\". He stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.<ref>{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|p=5}}</ref> The history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that \"the same laws of thought are applicable to all men\".<ref>{{harvnb|Waitz|1863|pp=11?12}}</ref>\n\nWaitz was influential among the British ethnologists. In 1863 the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton]] and the speech therapist [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] broke away from the [[Ethnological Society of London]] to form the [[Anthropological Society of London]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the French \'\'Soci?t?\'\' were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, \'\'The Anthropological Review\'\', Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.<ref name=hunt>{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|loc=Introductory Address}}</ref>{{refn|group=n|Hunt\'s choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.<ref name=hunt/>}} Among the first associates were the young [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[Alfred Tylor]], a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.\n\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed: The [[American Anthropological Association]] in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the [[:de:Berliner Gesellschaft f?r Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte|Berlin Society of Anthropology]] (1869) founded by [[Rudolph Virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin\'s conclusions lacked empirical foundation.\n\nDuring the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association.  The major theorists belonged to these organizations. They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. By 1898 the American Association for the Advancement of Science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.<ref>{{cite journal |  title=Extent of Instruction in Anthropology in Europe and the United States | first=George Grant | last=Maccurdy | journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science | year=1899 | pages=382?390 | url={{Google books|PA385&dq|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref>\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nThis meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world\'s higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. Organization has reached global level. For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA), \"a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology\", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.<ref>{{cite web | title=Home | publisher=World Council of Anthropological Associations | accessdate=29 March 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}</ref>\n\nSince the work of [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronis?aw Malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, \'\'social\'\' anthropology in Great Britain and [[cultural anthropology|\'\'cultural\'\' anthropology]] in the US have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[Participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research.

In the United States, anthropology has traditionally been divided into the [[four field approach]] developed by [[Franz Boas]] in the early 20th century: [[Biological anthropology|\'\'biological\'\' or \'\'physical\'\' anthropology]]; [[social anthropology|\'\'social\'\']], [[cultural anthropology|\'\'cultural\'\']], or [[sociocultural anthropology|\'\'sociocultural\'\' anthropology]]; and [[archaeology]]; plus [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]].

Several anthropologists have noted that the Western categories of \'painting\', \'sculpture\', or \'literature\', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western contexts.<ref>Robert Layton. (1981) \'\'The Anthropology of Art\'\'.</ref> To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being \'artistic\', have certain evident \'aesthetic\' qualities. Boas\' \'\'Primitive Art\'\', Claude L?vi-Strauss\' \'\'The Way of the Masks\'\' (1982) or Geertz\'s \'Art as Cultural System\' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of \'art\' into an anthropology of culturally specific \'aesthetics\'.\n\n==== Media ====\n{{main|Media anthropology}}\n[[File:Punu mask Gabon.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Punu tribe mask. Gabon Central Africa]]\nMedia anthropology (also known as anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.<ref>Deborah Spitulnik.

While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with [[ethnographic film]], visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and [[reception theory|reception]] of [[anthropology of media|mass media]].  Visual representations from all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.\n\n=== Economic, political economic, applied and development ===\n{{Economic anthropology}}\n\n==== Economic ====\n{{main|Economic anthropology}}\nEconomic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the Polish-British founder of Anthropology, [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], and his French compatriot, [[Marcel Mauss]], on the nature of gift-giving exchange (or [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]]) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy focuses on production, in contrast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hann|first=Chris|title=Economic Anthropology|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=55?71|author2=Keith Hart}}</ref> Economic Anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.\n\n====Political economy====\n{{main|Political economy in anthropology}}\nPolitical economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the \"pre-capitalist\" societies that were subject to evolutionary \"tribal\" stereotypes. Sahlins work on Hunter-gatherers as the \'original affluent society\' did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world\'s population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.<ref name=\"Roseberry 1988 161?85\">{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161?85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}</ref> More recently, these Political Economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.\n\n==== Applied ====\n{{main|Applied anthropology}}\nApplied Anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. It is a, \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}</ref> More simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. It is closely related to [[Development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[Anthropology of development]]).\n\n====Development====\n{{main|anthropology of development}}\nAnthropology of development  tends to view development from a \'\'critical\'\' perspective. The kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail?\n\n===Kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality===\n{{Anthropology of kinship}}\n\n==== Kinship ====\n{{main|Kinship}}\n\'\'Kinship\'\' can refer both to \'\'the study of\'\' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to \'\'the patterns of social relationships\'\' themselves. Over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as \"[[kinship|descent]]\", \"[[descent group]]s\", \"[[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]s\", \"[[affinity (law)|affine]]s\", \"[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]\", and even \"[[fictive kinship]]\". Broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one\'s social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.\n\n==== Feminist ====\n{{main|Feminist anthropology}}\nFeminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. Anthropology engages often with feminists from non-Western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white European and American feminists. Historically, such \'peripheral\' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. Feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. Feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. Feminist anthropology is inclusive of [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html birth anthropology] as a specialization.\n\n===Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal===\n{{Medical anthropology}}\n\n==== Medical ====\n{{main|Medical anthropology}}\n\nMedical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies \"human health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural adaptation\".<ref name=McElroy1996>{{Cite book |year=1996 |author=McElroy, A |chapter=Medical Anthropology |editor=D.

Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>  Currently, research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole. It focuses on  the following six basic fields:{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n<blockquote>\n* the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care\n* the patient-physician relationship\n* the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments\n* the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole\n*the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations (\"critical ethnopsychiatry\": Beneduce 2004, 2007)\n* the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western settings\n</blockquote>\n\nOther subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003; Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as \'\'cultural psychiatry\'\' and \'\'transcultural psychiatry\'\' or \'\'ethnopsychiatry\'\'.\n\n==== Nutritional ====\n{{main|Nutritional anthropology}}\n\nNutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.\n\n==== Psychological ====\n{{main|Psychological anthropology}}\nPsychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans\' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group?with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories?shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.<ref>D\'Andrade, R. G. (1995). The development of cognitive anthropology. New York, Cambridge University Press.</ref><ref>Schwartz, T., G. M. White, et al., Eds. (1992). New Directions in Psychological Anthropology. Cambridge, UK, Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==== Cognitive ====\n{{main|Cognitive anthropology}}\nCognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|D\'Andrade|1995}}</ref>\n\n==== Transpersonal ====\n{{main|Transpersonal anthropology}}\nTranspersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues?for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences (Young and Goulet 1994).\n\n===Political and legal===\n{{Political anthropology}}\n\n==== Political ====\n{{main|Political anthropology}}\nPolitical anthropology concerns the structure of [[Form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more \"complex\" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes  were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. Geertz\' comparative work on \"Negara\", the Balinese state is an early, famous example.\n\n====Legal====\n{{main|Legal anthropology}}\nLegal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in \"the cross-cultural study of social ordering\".<ref>{{cite book | author = Greenhouse, Carol J. | title = Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town | location = Ithaca | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986 | page = 28}}</ref>  Earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. More  recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York|editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}</ref>  and political uprisings.\n\n====Public====\n{{main|Public anthropology}}\nPublic Anthropology was created by Robert Borofsky, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University, to \"demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline - illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change\" ([http://www.publicanthropology.org Borofsky 2004]).\n\n=== Nature, science and technology===\n{{Cyber anthropology}}\n\n====Cyborg====\n{{main|Cyborg anthropology}}\nCyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]\'s annual meeting in 1993. The sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].<ref>Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001</ref> [[Donna Haraway]]\'s 1985 \'\'[[Cyborg Manifesto]]\'\' could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term. Cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built, specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings.\n\n==== Digital ====\n{{main|Digital anthropology}}\nDigital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital-era technology, and extends to various areas where anthropology and [[technology]] intersect. It is sometimes grouped with [[cultural anthropology|sociocultural anthropology]], and sometimes considered part of [[material culture]].  The field is new, and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases. These include techno-anthropology,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.studyguide.aau.dk/programmes/postgraduate/53203/ | title=Techno-Anthropology course guide | publisher=Aalborg University | accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> digital ethnography, cyberanthropology,<ref>{{cite book | url=http://xirdalium.net/category/anthropology/cyberanthropology/ | title=Cyberanthropology | publisher=Peter Hammer Verlag Gmbh | date=August 2011 | accessdate=14 March 2013 | author=Knorr, Alexander | isbn=978-3-7795-0359-0}}</ref> and virtual anthropology.<ref>{{cite book | title=Virtual Anthropology: A guide to a new interdisciplinary field | publisher=Springer | author=Weber, Gerhard & Bookstein, Fred | year=2011 | isbn=978-3-211-48647-4}}</ref>\n\n==== Ecological ====\n{{main|Ecological anthropology}}\nEcological anthropology is defined as the \"study of [[cultural adaptation]]s to environments\".<ref name=\"Kottak\">{{cite book|last=Kottak|first=Conrad Phillip|title=Anthropology : appreciating human diversity|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-811699-5|pages=579?584|edition=14th}}</ref> The sub-field is also defined as, \"the study of relationships between a population of humans and their [[biophysical environment]]\".<ref name=\"Townsend\">{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Patricia K.|title=Environmental anthropology : from pigs to policies|year=2009|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=978-1-57766-581-6|page=104|edition=2nd}}</ref> The focus of its research concerns \"how cultural [[beliefs]] and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their [[ecosystems]].\"<ref name=\"Kottak\"/>\n\n====Environmental====\n{{main|Environmental anthropology}}\nEnvironmental anthropology is a sub-specialty  within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.<ref name=\"Kottak CP 1999\">{{cite journal|last1=Kottak|first1=Conrad P.|jstor=683339|title=The New Ecological Anthropology|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=101|page=23|year=1999|doi=10.1525/aa.1999.101.1.23}}</ref> The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is [[political ecology]].

It is also the study of the history of various [[ethnic group]]s that may or may not exist today. Ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation. Its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts. Practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral tradition, site exploration, archaeological materials, museum collections, enduring customs, language, and place names.<ref name=\"Axtell1979\">{{cite journal | last1 = Axtell | first1 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Ethnohistory: An Historian\'s Viewpoint | url = | journal = Ethnohistory | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 3?4 | doi = 10.2307/481465 }}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Anthropology of religion}}\n{{main|Anthropology of religion}}\nThe anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions, and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures. Modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between [[magical thinking]] and religion,<ref name=\"Cassirer1944\">[[Ernst Cassirer|Cassirer, Ernst]] (1944) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pe9fWSv-iLsC&pg=PA102 \'\'An Essay On Man\'\'], pt.II, ch.7 \'\'Myth and Religion\'\', pp.&nbsp;122?3.</ref>{{refn|group=n|\"It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.

[[Ulf Hannerz]] quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were \"a notoriously [[agoraphobic]] lot, anti-urban by definition\". Various social processes in the [[Western World]] as well as in the \"[[Third World]]\" (the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists) brought the attention of \"[[Anthropology#Focus on the \"other cultures\"|specialists in \'other cultures\']]\" closer to their homes.<ref>Hannerz, Ulf (1980). \'\'Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology\'\', p.1</ref> There are two principle approaches in urban anthropology: by examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities. These two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other. By defining different types of cities, one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities. By directly looking at the different social issues, one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city.<ref>Griffiths, Michael. B., Flemming Christiansen, and Malcolm Chapman.

It is a burgeoning [[interdisciplinary]] field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines, including anthropology, [[ethology]], medicine, [[psychology]], [[veterinary medicine]] and [[zoology]].  A major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human-animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions.<ref>Mills, Daniel S.

[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.<ref name=Biocult_syn>{{cite book |last= Goodman |first=Alan H. |author2= Thomas L.

Evolutionary anthropology is based in [[natural science]] and [[social science]], combining the [[Human development (biology)|human development]] with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a [[scientific]] approach, and brings together fields such as [[archaeology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[psychology]], [[primatology]], and [[genetics]]. It is a dynamic and [[interdisciplinary]] field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.\n\n=== Forensic ===\n{{main|Forensic anthropology}}\nForensic anthropology  is the application of the science of [[physical anthropology]] and human [[osteology]] in a legal setting, most often in criminal cases where the victim\'s remains are in the advanced stages of [[decomposition]]. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable. The adjective \"forensic\" refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law.\n\n=== Palaeoanthropology ===\n{{main|Palaeoanthropology}}\nPaleoanthropology combines the disciplines of [[paleontology]] and [[physical anthropology]]. It is the study of ancient humans, as found in [[fossil]] [[Hominidae|hominid]] evidence such as [[Petrifaction|petrifacted]] bones and footprints.\n\n== Organizations ==\nContemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA), which was founded in 1903.<ref>[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]</ref> Membership is made up of anthropologists from around the globe.<ref>[http://www.aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]</ref>\n\nIn 1989, a group of European and American scholars in the field of anthropology established the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in Europe. The EASA seeks to advance the status of anthropology in Europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology.\n\nHundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.<ref>Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong. \'\'Lucy\'s Legacy\'\'.

There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.<ref>Levi-Strauss, Claude.  \'\'The Savage Mind\'\'. 1962; Womack, Mari.  \'\'Being Human.\'\' 2001.{{Page needed|date=October 2012}}</ref>\n\nEthical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] (including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]]), and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery, and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies<ref>Harris, Marvin. \'\'Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches\'\'.</ref> to genes<ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&sectioncode=26 Timeshighereducation.co.uk]</ref> to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man\'s inhumanity to man]].

Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in World War I, and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.\n\nBut by the 1940s, many of Boas\' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the \"Axis\" (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David H. Price]]\'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.\n\nAttempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist [[Hugo Nutini]] was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).<ref>Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.</ref> Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement.  Numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).\n\nProfessional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous. The AAA\'s current \'Statement of Professional Responsibility\' clearly states that \"in relation with their own government and with host governments&nbsp;... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.\"\n\nAnthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army\'s strategy in Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm Christian Science Monitor]</ref> The \'\'[[Christian Science Monitor]]\'\' reports that \"Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs\" [[War in Afghanistan (2001?present)|in Afghanistan]], under the \'\'[[Human Terrain System]]\'\' (HTS) program; in addition, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20140121225645/http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|archivedate=21 January 2014}}</ref> In 2009, the American Anthropological Association\'s Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, \"When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment ? all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application ? it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. In summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, CEAUSSIC suggests that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing HTS to define the meaning of \"anthropology\" within DoD.\"<ref>[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ \"AAA Commission Releases Final Report on Army Human Terrain System\" American Anthropological Association<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Post?World War II developments==\nBefore WWII British \'social anthropology\' and American \'cultural anthropology\' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as \'sociocultural\' anthropology.\n\n===Basic trends===\nThere are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.<ref name=\"Hylland Eriksen 2004 p. 79\"/> The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.<ref>Rosaldo, Renato.  \'\'Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis\'\'.

Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[Culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.\n\n===Commonalities between fields===\nBecause anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of Anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], history, [[philosophy]], and [[religious studies]],<ref>Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D.

There has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people; increasingly, research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories, social movements, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses.<ref>Fischer, Michael M.

([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy==\n\nThe three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:\n*Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.\n*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops.\nAgricultural sciences include research and development on:\n* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)\n* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)\n* Minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems.\n* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)\n* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]])\n* [[Theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling\n* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.\n* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the USA and the EU.\n* Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.\n\n===Agricultural biotechnology===\n[[Agricultural biotechnology]] is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular markers]], [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccines]], and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganisms]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=What is Agricultural Biotechnology? | publisher=Cornell University | accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Fertilizer ==\nOne of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop\'s C to N ratio and the local environment\n\n==A local science==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nWith the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.\n\n==History of agricultural science==\n{{Main|History of agricultural science}}\n\nAgricultural science began with [[Gregor Mendel]]\'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in 18th-century Germany.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887]], which used the term \"agricultural science\". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers\' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.<ref>Hillison J. (1996).

[[Blackwell Publishing]].</ref>{{rp|xxi}}\n\nIntensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.\n\nAs the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic \'goods\'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.\n\nNew technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.\n\n==Prominent agricultural scientists==\n[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|Norman Borlaug, father of the [[Green Revolution]].]]\n* [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]]\n* [[Norman Borlaug]]\n* [[Luther Burbank]]\n* [[George Washington Carver]]\n* [[Ren?

These traditions\' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and \"genetic\" relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.\n\n===Hellenistic Egypt===\n[[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]], from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], \'\'Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs\'\' (3 vol., Paris, 1887?1888).]]\n\nThe start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to [[Egypt (Roman province)|Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.<ref>\'\'New Scientist\'\', 24?31 December 1987</ref> Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West.

They wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]] and lived in [[Egypt]] under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule.\n\n\'\'\'Mythology\'\'\' ? Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work|publisher=Routledge &Kegan Paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=0-415-11965-0}}</ref> Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.<ref>Yves Bonnefoy. \'Roman and European Mythologies\'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211?213</ref>  These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.\n\nThe central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]]. Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy\'s principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the \"forty-two books of Hermes\", covering all fields of knowledge.<ref>[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, \'\'Stromata\'\', vi. 4.]]</ref> The \'\'[[Hermetica]]\'\' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.\n\n\'\'\'Technology\'\'\' ? The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of [[metallurgy]], extending back to 3500&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=12}}</ref> Many writings were lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books<ref>{{cite book|last=Partington|first=James Riddick|title=A Short History of Chemistry|year=1989|pages=20|isbn=0-486-65977-1|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York}}</ref> after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ({{sc|ad}}&nbsp;292).

Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy\'s character.<ref name=\"Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13\"/> An important example of alchemy\'s roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.<ref>{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn= 0-389-01006-5 | page=16 }}</ref> The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; \"...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word.

It means the art of obtaining/manipulating \'\'Rasa\'\': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.}}\nThe goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit \'\'divya-deham\'\') and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit \'\'j?van-mukti\'\').  Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god ?iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Dev?.\n\nSome early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the [[Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]].

[[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship.\n\nIn the late 8th century, [[J?bir ibn Hayy?n]] (Latinized as \"Geber\" or \"Geberus\") introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on [[scientific method]]ology and controlled [[experiment]]ation in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.<ref name=Kraus/> Jabir is thus \"considered by many to be the father of [[chemistry]]\",<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Zygmunt S.|last=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations of Crystallography|volume=64|pages=246?258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D }}</ref> albeit others reserve that title for [[Robert Boyle]] or [[Antoine Lavoisier]].

One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....\n\nThe study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.\n\nIt is different with Jabir\'s alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the \'\'[[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]]\'\' and the \'\'`amal\'\'.

The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.\n\nIslamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir\'s ultimate goal was \'\'[[Takwin]]\'\', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of \'\'hotness\'\', \'\'coldness\'\', \'\'dryness\'\', and \'\'moistness\'\'.<ref name=burckhardt29/> According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.<ref name=burckhardt29>{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans.

Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance\'s name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element\'s physical properties.\n\nThe elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], \"the stone which burns\", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.<ref name=\"r8\">Strathern, Paul.

The [[philosopher\'s stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher\'s stone was often equated with the [[universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.\n\n[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists.

Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.\n\nChinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to martial arts such as [[T\'ai chi ch\'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical).

Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105?108}}</ref> Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[al-Razi]].

Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century [[Anselm of Canterbury|St&nbsp;Anselm]] put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm\'s work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, [[Robert Grosseteste]] used Abelard\'s methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.<ref name=hollister294f>{{cite book | author=Hollister, C.

The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.<ref>John Read. \'\'From Alchemy to Chemistry.\'\' 1995 p.90</ref> Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican monk]], is known to have written works such as the \'\'Book of Minerals\'\' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.<ref>James A. Weisheipl. \'\'Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.\'\' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202</ref> Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert\'s student [[Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nRoger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan monk]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his \'\'[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]\'\' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy\'s connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon\'s writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.<ref>Edmund Brehm. \"Roger Bacon\'s Place in the History of Alchemy.\" \'\'Ambix.\'\' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.</ref> Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120?121}}</ref> In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner\'s questions.\n\nSoon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His \'\'Summa Perfectionis\'\' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134?141}}.</ref> By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man\'s soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man\'s soul, man could be reunited with God.<ref>{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans.

Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.<ref>Tara E. Nummedal. \'\'Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.\'\' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49</ref> [[Dante]], [[Piers Plowman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars.

These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of [[Petrus Bonus]], [[John of Rupescissa]], and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.<ref>Leah DeVun. \'\'From Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages.\'\' Columbia University Press, 2009. p. 104</ref>\n\n[[Nicolas Flamel]] is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of [[pseudepigraphy]], the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous.

Most of \'his\' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher\'s stone.<ref>{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | pages=170?181 | others=Trans.

The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.\n\nIn the late 15th century, [[Marsilo Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.\n\nEsoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.<ref>Peter J.

Nummedal. \'\'Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.\'\' p.171</ref>  False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.\n\nThe terms \"chemia\" and \"alchemia\" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546?1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Micha? S?dziw?j|Michael Sendivogius]] (\'\'Micha? S?dziw?j\'\', 1566?1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton\'s occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermetism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Boyle]]\nThe decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for \"ancient wisdom\". Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its [[apogee]] in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: \"Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more?plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof.\"<ref name=\"Alchemy Restored\">Principe, Lawrence M. \"Alchemy Restored.\" Isis 102.2 (2011): 305-12.

Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.<ref>{{cite book | author=Pilkington, Roger | title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry | location=London | publisher=John Murray | year=1959 | page=11 }}</ref> This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]].\n\nBeginning around 1720, a rigid distinction was drawn between \"alchemy\" and \"chemistry\" for the first time.<ref name=\"NewmanPrincipe2002p37\">{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}</ref><ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp386\">{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}</ref> By the 1740s, \"alchemy\" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.<ref name=\"Alchemy Restored\"/><ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp386\"/> In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to separate and divorce the \"new\" chemistry from the \"old\" practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.<ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanpp386?7\">{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386?7}}</ref>\n\nDuring the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.<ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp387\">{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}</ref><ref name=\"KripalShuck2005p27\">{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}</ref> The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.<ref name=\"NewmanPrincipe2002p37\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}</ref><ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp388\">{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}</ref> This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.<ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp388\"/>\n\nIn the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: \"No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy.\"<ref name=\"PrincipeNewmanp391\">{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}</ref><ref name=\"Rutkin2001p143\">{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}</ref> Atwood\'s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his \'\'Remarks Upon Alchymists\'\' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.<ref>Daniel Merkur. \'\'Gnosis: An Esoteric Tradition of Mystical Visions and Unions.\'\' SUNY Press. 1993 p.55</ref>\n\n===Modern historical research===\nThe history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.<ref name=\"Antoine Faivre 1995. p.viii?xv\">Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. \'\'Western esotericism and the science of religion.\'\' 1995. p.viii?xvi</ref>   As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.<ref>[http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/ See Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism website]</ref> Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Exeter]] Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the [[European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]] (ESSWE), and the [[University of Amsterdam]]\'s Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam.\n\nJournals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include \'[[Ambix]]\', published by the Society for the History of alchemy and Chemistry, and \'[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]\', published by The History of Science Society.\n\n==Core concepts==\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006104 Theosophie ^ Alchemie ^ Judentum ^ Kabbala.jpg|thumb|Mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts, symbols, and processes. From \'\'Spiegel der Kunst und Natur\'\'.]]\nWestern alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from [[Neoplatonism]] and earlier Greek [[cosmology]]. As such, the [[Classical elements]] appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven [[Classical planets]] and the corresponding seven [[metals of antiquity]]. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of [[prima materia]] and [[anima mundi]] are central to the theory of the [[philosopher\'s stone]].\n\n===Hermetism===\nIn the eyes of a variety of esoteric and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.<ref name=\"Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96\"/> The writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] are a primary source of alchemical theory. He is named \"alchemy\'s founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|pp=9}}</ref>\n\nEarly alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.<ref>Allen G. Debus. \'\'Alchemy and early modern chemistry.\'\' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.</ref> This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for [[spirit|spiritual entities]], spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of \'Alchemical Formulas\' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. Practitioners and patrons such as [[Melchior Cibinensis]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]] existed within the ranks of the church, while [[Martin Luther]] applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.<ref>Raphael Patai. \'\'The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.\'\' Princeton University Press. p.4</ref> Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher\'s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.\n\nIn his 1766 \'\'Alchemical Catechism\'\', Th?odore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was a symbol:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver? \nA. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.<ref>Th?odore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his \'\'L\'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Soci?t? des Franc-Ma?ons consider?e sous tous les aspects.\'\' 1766.  (A.E. Waite translation as found in \'\'The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.\'\')</ref></poem>}}\n\n===Magnum opus===\n{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}\nThe Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.\n\n*\'\'[[nigredo]]\'\', a blackening or melanosis\n*\'\'[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]\'\', a whitening or leucosis\n*\'\'[[citrinitas]]\'\', a yellowing or xanthosis\n*\'\'[[rubedo]]\'\', a reddening, purpling, or iosis<ref>Joseph Needham. \'\'Science & Civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology. Spagyrical discovery and invention: magisteries of gold and immortality.\'\' Cambridge. 1974. p.23</ref>\n\n==Modern alchemy==\nDue to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}</ref> Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the \'decknamen\' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These practitioners have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.<ref>Richard Conniff. \"Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was.\" [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/#ixzz2sYcrpZl7 Smithsonian Magazine.] February 2014.</ref>\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, esoteric alchemists interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts. Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}</ref> Groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, \"occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances.\",<ref name=\"Alchemy Restored\"/> which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought.\n\n===Traditional medicine===\n{{main|Ayurveda|Traditional Chinese medicine}}\nTraditional medicine sometimes involves the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Ayurveda]], the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are claimed to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.<ref>Junius, Manfred M; \'\'The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist\'s Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs\'\'; Healing Arts Press 1985</ref>\n \nSpagyrists of the 20th century, [[Frater Albertus|Albert Richard Riedel]] and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, \'\'Les Philosophes de la Nature\'\' and \'\'The Paracelsus Research Society\'\', popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.<ref>Joscelyn Godwin.  \'\'The Golden Thread: The Ageless Wisdom of the Western Mystery Traditions.\'\' Quest Books, 2007. p.120</ref> The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice.\n\n===Psychology===\nAlchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of \'\'The Secret of the Golden Flower\'\', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the internal or psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. He called the creation of the gold or lapis within the process of \"[[individuation]].\"<ref name=\"Jung, C. G. 1944\">Jung, C. G. (1944).

London: Routledge.</ref><ref name=\"Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. \'\'The Cambridge companion to Jung.\'\' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33\" /> Together with his alchemical \'\'mystica soror,\'\' Jungian Swiss analyst, Marie-Louise von Franz, Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy\'s popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the \'\'[[hieros gamos]]\'\'  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]])<ref>C.-G.

Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, \'\'Mysterium Conuinctionis.\'\'\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}\nAlchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. \'\'Literary alchemy\'\' appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to J. K. Rowling. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.\n\nVisual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|3|\n*[[Alchemy in art and entertainment]]\n*[[Biological transmutation]]\n*[[Chemistry]]\n*[[Chinese alchemy]]\n*[[Cupellation]]\n*[[Hermes Trismegistus]]\n*[[Historicism]]\n*[[History of chemistry]]\n*[[List of alchemists]]\n*[[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]]\n*[[Magnum opus (alchemy)]]\n*[[Mary the Jewess]]\n*[[Nuclear transmutation]]\n*[[Outline of alchemy]]\n*[[Philosopher\'s Stone]]\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Porta Alchemica]]\n*[[Scientific method]]\n*[[Superseded scientific theories]]\n*[[Synthesis of precious metals]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last= Calian |first= George |authorlink= |title= Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa.

A related but distinct subject, [[cosmology]], is concerned with studying the [[Universe]] as a whole. An astronomer researches the world beyond [[Earth]].\n\n== Academic ==\n{{For|subdisciplines|Outline of astronomy}}\n[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of [[modern astronomy]]]]\n[[Image:Br Guy in Lab.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Guy Consolmagno]] (Vatikan observatory), analyzing a meteorite, 2014]]\n[[Image:Emily_Lakdawalla_at_FameLab_at_LPSC_2013.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Emily Lakdawalla]] at the Planetary Conference 2013]]\n[[History of astronomy|Historically]], astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astrophysics]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms \"astronomer\" and \"astrophysicist\" are interchangeable. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=NOAO | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090403101540/http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory.\n\nThe number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,000 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=AAS| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090802044012/http://aas.org/| archivedate= 2 August 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU}}</ref>\n\nContrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a [[telescope]] through the dark hours of the night, it is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, [[photographic plates]] were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year. Analysis of observed phenomena, along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe, takes the majority of observational astronomers\' time.\n\nAstronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service to encourage interest in the field.\n\n== Amateur astronomers ==\n\nWhile there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers, the field is popular among [[amateurs]]. Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host [[star party|star parties]]. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225074145/http://astrosociety.org/about.html| archivedate= 25 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research.

The duty being performed may only exist if an altruistic viewpoint is taken. Ethical egoists would deny the very existence of most duties to others, and in fact a devout ethical egoist would claim to perform in full all duties to others. I\'m not quite sure what this statement should be changed to, it\'s certainly \"almost there\" (it distinguishes, for example, the instance of a person who likes to think of himself as an altruist but, like a sinning Catholic, fails to perform the duties that imposes upon him) but if you mention duties then some mention of the origin of these duties is really required. I suspect that the best choice of action would be to avoid the mention of duties altogether. [[User:VivaEmilyDavies|VivaEmilyDavies]] 15:17, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\nModified the introduction in the following manner: I added the concept of I call \"behavioral altruism\" and disintingished it from what I call \"motivational altruism.\" I didn\'t refer to these terms as such because I doubt they\'re standard terminology, but the concepts define what are legitimately two different kinds of altruism. And, I noted that altruism is also the name of an ethical doctrine. (RJII NOV2004)\n\nI created the header \"Altruism in Politics\" and introduced a few sentences as a starter. (RJII NOV2004)\n\nI did a pretty radical reworking of the intro. I think it is necessary to define altruism in a broad manner that includes all perspectives that we cover in the article. I tried to outline the main topics of the article in the introduction. At some point, I think it would be good to include a comment like \"different perspectives on altruism can arise from using narrow or broad definitions of self-interest. At one extreme, self-interest is limited to definite material benefits for the actor, while at the other extreme self-interest includes psychological rewards.\" I don\'t know whether this should be in the introduction or deeper in the article. It helps clarify some of the differences among schools of philosophy and fields of research. [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 20:04, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n----\nThis article has a lot of basic content, but it needs some editing. First, the organization needs to be straightened out. I think it would help to dedicate a section to Philosophy and Ethics, separate from Psychology and Sociology. I think it would also be good to address human altruism separately from altruism in other creatures. As the article stands, those two topics blur together. Finally, thru much of the article, I get the feeling that this is an argument, where people are throwing out whatever argument they can think of and then someone elses refutes the point. This really destroys the focus of the article. [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 01:11, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n:OK, I agree largely with that. I wrote most of the philosophy stuff but I\'m not really qualified to do any overall editing because I\'m not confident enough on the details of my sociology/psychology. Animal and human altruism can be usefully separated as long as the links are pointed out; at the end of the day humans are animals too, but I can see the pragmatic reasons for separating. [[User:Randywombat|Toby W]] 17:50, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)\nX-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.16\n\n::I did what I could. The last main section(psychology and sociology) is the most troublesome. First, there is really no psychology or sociology in there; there are a lot of ideas of how altruism may have evolved in humans, but no actual information about how altruism is actually exhibited in humans. I was tempted to just remove that section heading, but it would be great to real information about altruism in human psychology (when is it exhibited, what similarities/differences are there among societies, is it related to spite?) That section still has too much argument in it, and is not always NPOV. The proposed evolution of consciousness is too speculative and long. [[User:AdamRetchless|AdamRetchless]] 03:03, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)\n----\nAltruism doesn\'t really exist.  Even if you are doing something that is helpful or charitable for others, you will still reap the good of that action.  The idea that one should do things for altruistic purposes is wrong and can lead to the downfall of society, as [[:Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand]] wrote about in AtlasShrugged.  \nIf one portrays that they are doing something completely for others benefit and has no self interest, that is when you should question thier motives.  Why do they wish to appear so benevolent?  When one does for other people at least there are good feelings that arise and right there, the theory of altruism is defunct or never existed.\n\nThat\'s fucking right\n----\nThe foregoing view is known as \'\'[[:psychological egoism|psychological egoism]]\'\' and is widely dismissed by philosophers, for reasons that somebody ought to explain. \n\n\'\'There\'s not a lot to explain; there is plain and simple empirical evidence of people doing altruistic acts.  People sometimes do generous things even if it makes them unhappy.  Of course you could say this is to get one\'s conscience to leave you alone, but since a conscience is darn close to an AltruismInstinct, that\'s pretty weak.\'\'\n\n\'\'People evolved to have empathy towards others and do altruistic things because that\'s good for everybody in general, though not always in specifics.  Whether altruism makes any sense, of course, is a different matter, though I wouldn\'t personally say it doesn\'t.\'\'\n----\nWhen you say \'\'\'widely dismissed\'\'\', do you have anything to actually back that up?  What philosophers have dismissed this idea?  I would like to know how you can substantiate your criticism.\n----\nYou can find it dismissed in any of many dozens of general philosophy textbooks as well as books about ethics.  Here is just [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/e/egoism.htm one example].  It is hackneyed, among professional philosophers, to say that [[:psychological egoism|psychological egoism]] is untenable.  By the way, in saying that it has been dismissed, I don\'t pretend to be making a \'\'criticism\'\'--just pointing out a fact.  \n----\nActually, I was asking that someone else take the time to make the \'\'criticism\'\' plain.\n\nBy the way, you might not know that [[:Ayn Rand|Ayn Rand]] herself rejected [[:psychological egoism|psychological egoism]] very firmly, as a matter of fact.  (Not that that\'s an argument!)\n\nAlso, I\'d say that this discussion should probably be removed to the [[:psychological egoism|psychological egoism]] page, because it presents that view, rather than discussing altruism itself.  That\'s just my opinion, I\'ll leave it up to you. -- [[:Larry Sanger|Larry Sanger]]\n----\nHow about this for a definition of altruism?  I think it needs some revision, but perhaps it is a useful start.\n\nThe view that one ought to be motivated solely or primarily by the interests of others rather than the interests of oneself.\nAltruism is then viewed as a conclusion, rather than a foundation or argument -- presumably some meta-ethical argument would be needed in order to explain why we ought to be altruistic. --[[:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]]\n\n----\n62.60.54.xxx, I strongly recommend you read [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome, newcomers]] with particular attention to [[Wikipedia policy]] and [[Wikipettiquette]].

Communism as a political philosophy prescribes altruistic behavior...the   individual lives and works to benefit the collective. If you look at the writings of \"communist\" dictators it\'s what they are trying to accomplish and enforce...to force what they see as a moral obligation of everyone to be altruistic. If you\'re going to enforce that people relenquish self-interest for others, then obviously there are going to be some rights issues. I definitely think Communism should be listed in there. (RJII) Dec 27\n\n::::I don\'t see how your conclusion is based on your argument. You say [http://www.protestwarrior.com/new_signs.php?sign=4 Communism has only failed every time...]. I say \"Not all socialism is the same however, and it better serves the reader to to remain more vague\". You say \"I definitely think Communism should be listed in there.\" Why? {{Vip|user=Sam_Spade}} 18:40, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\n:::::I just told you why. The belief that people have a moral obligation to help others (ethical altruism) is frequently behind the advocacy of political systems such as communism. I\'m not sure if I can make it any clearer. There are people who advocate communism because they think the pursuit of self-interest is neglecting what they believe to be a moral calling for individuals to work for benefit of the group. Do you disagree? If so, what about that isn\'t correct? (RJII) Dec 27\n\nFrankly, the whole \"altruism in politics\" section is one big objectivist [[straw man]]. Certainly, altruism can be (and is) used as a basis for various forms of socialism (including communism), but it can just as easily be used as a basis for \'\'any other\'\' political or economic system. An altruist could believe that pure laissez-faire capitalism best serves the common good, for example, and support it for that reason.\nIn other words, all socialists are altruists, but not all altruists are socialists. An altruist will support the system he believes to be the best for humanity as a whole - whatever system that is. -- [[User:Mihnea Tudoreanu|Mihnea Tudoreanu]] 12:37, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:Then say it in the article. If it can stand up to the light of reason, great. But I think you are out of line to deleted the whole section, because it\'s obvious that ethical altruism is influential in politics. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 00:31, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\nLarge deletions are indeed frowned upon. That said, Mihnea has a point. Perhaps we should shorten the section, and focus on [[Positive liberty|positive]] vrs. [[Negative liberty|negative freedom]]? {{Vip|user=Sam_Spade}} 01:43, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\n\nIf I can throw in an outsider\'s voice here, it seems like alturism can be used to justify virtually any popular political system.  The controversial pair of paragraphs seems to really be meaningless.  Namely, I can make the following modifications to the final paragraph, which expands its meaning to a more general case:\n\n<blockquote>\nAltruism, as an ethical doctrine, together with the belief that enforcement of the doctrine is morally permissible, is frequently the ideology behind support of particular governmental actions such as <strike>transfer payments</strike> <u>the arrest of murderers</u> or behind the establishment and support of entire political systems themselves, such as <strike>theocracy, socialism or totalitarianism</strike> <u>republics</u>.  Within <strike>these</strike> <u>this</u> systems the individual acts to benefit the group (see collectivism), particular groups, other individuals, or the state rather than pursues his self-interest as he sees\n</blockquote>\n:::No, because the arrest of murderers isn\'t an enforcement of altruism. It\'s an enforcement of the freedom of another to live ..to not be subject to assault. Refresh yourself on what the ethical doctrine of altruism is. It\'s the belief that people have a moral obligation to help other people. And, this means \"help\" as in doing ..performing a positive action, as opposed to \'\'refraining\'\' from doing, or refraining from murdering. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 22:43, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::Hmmm.  Good point, but you\'re making a distinction that not everyone believes to exist.  It\'s not really possible to make a rigorous definition of inaction (does breathing count as action?).  Also, \"freedom to live\" is an unusual formation ... one could just as easily arrest everyone who drives an SUV for violating someone else\'s \"freedom to breathe clean air\".\n:::::Likewise, arresting someone for violating someone\'s \"freedom to breathe clean air\", is not arresting them for \"not helping\" someone, but for harming them. There is a distinct difference. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 03:36, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::[comment removed, it was getting off track] -- [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']]\n\n::::The dictionary at hand gives the first definition of \"altruism\" as \"unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others.\"  That isn\'t explicitly positive -- lacking a regard or devotion for the welfare of others removes the moral barrier to murder.  So perhaps Rand used the word in a different way than most people?\n:::::This is a source of a lot of confusion about Rand. When Rand speaks of \"altruism\" she does say that she\'s speaking of the \'\'ethical doctrine\'\' called altruism. That\'s not the same thing as the \"altruism\" people refer to colloquially. She\'s opposed to the belief that people have a \'\'moral obligation\'\' to help others. Again, this is about helping others..taking positive action to do good for them, not refraining from harming them. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 03:36, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::I don\'t see anywhere else where this definition of the ethical doctrine is given.  From what you\'re saying, it sounds like Rand was using a different definition than everybody else, which should be noted.  As it stands, the reader has no way of knowing that the type of altruism being discussed is only the positive part of altruism. [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 16:04, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:::::::It\'s given a few times in the article. It sounds like you haven\'t read the article. It\'s talked about in the intro as well as early in the article in reference to August Comte. It\'s not a use of the word \"different from everybody else.\" It\'s the common use of the word when people are talking in the context of normative ethics. Altruism is one of many ethical doctrines. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 16:29, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::Are you referring to \"one\'s actions ought to further the interests or good of other people\"?  That seems to encompass both the positive and negative aspects of altruism, because it assumes that people, as part of their nature, will act, and then says that those actions should be furthering the interests or good of other people -- possibly by acting in a manner that does not involve murdering them.  If one considers inaction to be a special case of action (as, I assume, most people who consider themselves supporters of altruism do, and as the that sentence also does), then there is no difference between positive and negative altruism.  However, I now see that from other points of view, there is such a distinction.  That should probably be mentioned. [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 17:06, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::::I do stand corrected on something after thinking about your comments. Altruism doesn\'t just apply to prescribing action, but can also apply to proscribing action. For example, refraining from eating your dinner so that someone else can eat it. But as far as refraining from mudering someone, that goes beyond what altruism is about. Altruism is about bestowing a positive benefit on someone ..meaning providing something to them that they did not have if you would not have acted (or refrained from acting) [[User:RJII|RJII]] 20:16, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC) \n\n::::So perhaps what should be said is that the negative aspect of altruism is behind the regulation aspect of government (people should be coerced into not doing harm), and the positive aspect is behind coercing people to pay taxes to build schools and roads, and coercing people to pull over for emergency vehicles. (Okay, my POV is sort of showing through in my choice of examples).  I think it\'s unfair to associate altruism with socialism -- again, I think that an egoist can be a socialist if they believe that it\'s better for them. [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 03:12, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:::::If the tax isn\'t used to help the person that is taxed, but someone else, sure. Of course, not everyone advocates \"welfare,\" for example, because they believe people have a moral obligation to help others. I suppose there\'s other reasons someone could advocate it that have nothing to do with morality. But then, that wouldn\'t be inlcluded in the political discussion since politics, in those cases, wouldn\'t be influenced by the altruism ethic. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 04:36, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC) \n::::::I was trying to say that, since politics, in those cases, wouldn\'t be influenced by the altruism ethic, it is incorrect to say that socialism requires altruism.  Furthermore, because pulling over for emergency vehicles is the same sort of behavior, it is misleading to make any sort of correlation with altruism and socialism, if it is not noted that there is a similar correlation between altruism and other, more common things, like public schools and emergency services.  But, then again, if the social contract-egoist makes this moot, then the section should just be removed.  [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 16:04, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::You\'re right, it would be incorrect to say that \"socialism requires altruism.\" And the section doesn\'t say that. It says that the ethical doctrine of altruism is frequently behind governmental actions as well as systems themselves. Some people think people have a moral obligation to help their fellow man, so they advocate systems and actions that embrace that doctrine. That ethical doctrine is highly influential. You can\'t count how many times a politician has said that people have an obligation to help others. If he thinks that, he\'s an ethical altruist, and that influences politics. As, far as socialism and altruism, communism (as a form of socialism) requires that the individual, rather than pursuing his self-interest, pursues benefiting the collective. As far as altruism being associate with something like public schools, I agree with you. Why not put that in? Public schools, for good or bad, are undeniably a socialist institution. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 16:29, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:::::::Okay.  The original statement is POV in that it ignores the most pandemic forms of altruism, public schooling, to focus on extreme forms of government.  Would it be correct to say that basically every political philosophy other than objectivism can be and is argued for on the basis of altruism? [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 17:06, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::Objectivism isn\'t a political philosophy. Maybe you\'re referring to capitalism? Well, how could it be argued that altruism is behind the advocacy of capitalism? In capitalism people are allowed to pursue their economic self-interest without limit, as long as they refrain from forcibly preventing others from pursuing their own. Someone can accumulate as much wealth as is possible without having to relenquish it for the benefit of others. What about capitalism has to do with altruism? nothing that i can see. You can try, in the article, to say that some people advocate capitalism because they think people have a moral obligation to help others, but I really don\'t see how it could stand up to reason. It wouldn\'t make sense. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 19:59, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:::::::::Sorry about the terminology breakdown there.  If capitalism is practiced to the extreme, to the point of eliminating public schooling, then, yes, it can be divorced from altruism.  However, I would bet that most people who consider themselves capitalists actually believe that public schools should exist.  I don\'t really like using the word \"capitalist\" because it can be used in different, but still emotionally-charged ways (looking it up, I now see that it means an owner of capital, even one who supports communism).  Someone who advocates a free market economy might be a capitalist, but that doesn\'t mean that they don\'t also advocate public schools.  So, we should break it down by people: almost all people (everyone but the objectivists, pretty much) use altruism as a justification for their overall political beliefs.  This seems like the way to go, because, presumably, a person either believes that altruism is morally required or not -- there\'s not really any sort of context that it can be put into. [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 21:22, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n:::::::::::You can be an advocate of capitalism while at the same time compromising a belief in an absolutely free market for practical purposes (many don\'t want pure capitalism but something that is relatively close to it). Making others pay to have your children schooled because you think it\'s a moral obligation of others to educate your children could be an example of this compromise. It\'s a legitimate point. Just put it in the section on how the ethical doctrine of altruism can influence politics if you wish. The influence of ethical altruism on government and politics is enormous. To wipe out the whole section lacks reasonable justification. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 22:27, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::::::If you define capitalism as being opposed to the idea of public schooling, than capitalism is highly unpopular.  Most people who support a free market do so, apparently, because they believe that it serves altruism best, because these people also support things that have altruism as a prerequisite.\n\n::::::::::::So, altruism itself (positive and negative) has an enormous impact on politics, by way of ethics and morality.  There are some people who reject positive altruism, and a smaller number who reject both halves of it.  The reason that I saw those paragraphs as being meaningless was that they were making a reference to socialism that was essentially a red herring: most political debate is not over \'\'whether\'\' we should be altruists, but \'\'how\'\' we should be altruists.  I think we\'ve more or less come to an agreement; I\'ll change/replace them soon (but I am apparently not a good enough altruist to fix the error immediately, before satisfying my own needs). [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 18:56, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::::::::I think you\'re equivocating different meanings of \"altruist.\" An altruist, in the context we\'ve been speaking, is a person that believes that altruistic behavior is a moral obligation. In this context, it\'s definitely not generally accepted in politics that we should be altruists. Nor is it generally agreed that we should perform altruistic acts. It\'s very common in political debate to argue whether an act should be performed that does not benefit the actor. I hope you\'re not equating altruistic behavior with benevolence. The former is an act that benefits others with no benefit to the self, while the latter is just helping other people (which can be done out of self-interested motivation). It\'s complicated to talk about altruism because basically you have three meanings. First you have the ethical doctrine, then you have the meaning that deals with behavior and results, then you have the probably colloquial meaning which is concerned with motivation for behavior. This is all pointed out in the article.  [[User:RJII|RJII]] 17:01, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\n\nThis version gives more information than the previous case (because it can be extrapolated to that other case), but wouldn\'t appear in the Wikipedia because it\'s a really boring statement.  (analogously: \"all murderers need [[water]] to survive\" is invalidated by \"all humans need water to survive.\")\n\nI think that this also indicates that the last sentence is sorta POV.  A non-alturist can be a socialist if they believe that, by agreeing to a socialist [[social contract]], they can do better than in another sort of state (whether or not that is true is beside the point).\n:Perfectly good point. Rather than advocating socialism for moral reasons, one may just think it works better. If he thinks that moral obligation arises from determining what works the best, then his ethical doctrine is \"consequentialism,\" but that\'s another article. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 16:29, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\nSo, ethical alturism may be important to politics, but it\'s important to note that almost everyone (assuming that objectivists are not more than 10% of the population) subscribes to it,<small> (digression begins around here) and everyone argues for their views in terms of it (an objectivist can\'t tell someone else, \"be an objectivist because it\'s good for me\", they have to argue that it\'s good for the other person).  (Note: I fudged a little here.  The hypothetical objectivist need not invoke alturism, but makes an argument that can be translated into an argument from alturism, or something like it.) </small> Sorry about writing so much, [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 04:38, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n\n----\n\n(getting closer to resolution.  Truly, edit wars are better heard than fought)\n\nWhat does the \"coercion\" paragraph have that the \"taxation\" paragraph lacks?  I think that they\'re both saying the same thing, but the former has strange phrasing, especially since it uses the valid, but loaded word \"coercion\" in an unusual way.  In particular, I think people who accept the idea of a [[social contract]] or who believe that representative governments have inherent [[sovereignty]] would disagree with the usage.  (Sort of analogous to calling cleaning \"destructive\" to dirt --- it is, but \"destructive\" has a negative connotation, and no one cares about the dirt\'s point of view.  Similarly, many people would say that the idea of having a right to do something immoral is unimportant or irrelevant.

[[User:RJII|RJII]] 19:37, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)\n::But taxation \'\'is\'\' coercion.

There are boundary cases to which there is no good distinction (Is it harm to allow a person to starve?  If so, then welfare is justified without the help of \"altruism\", by the currently-in-the-article definition.

And, you are really taking this to the point of absurdity if you claim that doing absolutely nothing constitutes helping others. If you sit in your house instead of going out and shooting everyone on your block then you are helping those people? Come on. You\'re not doing a damned thing for them. If someone is being helped then they\'re getting something that they didn\'t have before. Not going out and killing people is not helping them, because they\'re already alive! Won\'t you realize how ridiculous your claim is? For the sake of sanity, just drop it. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 04:10, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n:::::::::: My claim regarding the help/hurt issue is thus: it is in the interest of a person to not be killed.  I didn\'t say that doing nothing helps others --- I said that the definition of \"altruism\" includes both helping others and not hurting them, which I find to be clearly supported by the dictionary definition.  You seem to be drifting from the topic at hand, which is whether philosophers use \"altruism\" differently when talking about what people think they ought to do (ethics) and when talking about the things that people do do (behavior).  I keep beating on this one point in hopes I will see some dictionary definition that states that altruism (the ethic, the behavior, anything will do) is the helping of other people, not acting in their interests.  [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 07:49, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n:::::::: (Actually, it seems more like altruism is a component of an ethical philosophy.  For example, it is mandated by deontology and utilitarianism (because both require the consideration of the interests of others), and also by most religious positions on ethics that I can think of.  These things are not all the same, altruism is just a component of them.  Which, I suppose is why the definition is about which ethical views are \"form[s] of ethical altruism,\" not what is ethical altruism itself.  So I guess, according to them, altruism is a class of ethical philosophies.  Not a big distinction, but it is somewhat important, because it\'s important not to give the false impression that all altruists think alike.  The article should definitely point out that altruism is not linked to any set of actions, it is simply a justification for action.)

Ethical altruism is a belief that people \'\'should\'\' do something, and \"normal\" altruism is a description of a motivation or behavior that people do. It is beyond your scope of comprehension that one word can refer to two different things? Is this what your point is? Are you trying to figure out if altruism refers to two different things? All I can tell you is of course it does. Look at a dictionary. Merriam-Webster says it is the unselfish regard or devotion for others, but doesn\'t mention that it\'s also the name of an ethical doctrine. So, if you want to see that it\'s the name of an ethical doctrine then you need to consult another dictionary ..just as you did when you looked in the Cambridge dictionary of philosophy. Altruism is a word that describes at least two different things. One is what M-W describes and the other is an ethical doctrine.  The fact that the M-W dictionary doesn\'t point out that it\'s also the name of an ethical doctrine doesn\'t mean that their definition of altruism CONFLICTS with a definition that says it\'s the name of an ethical doctrine. It\'s just that the word refers to two different things. Look up the word \"homograph.\" \"Altruism\" is a homograph --meaning it\'s one of two words spelled exactly the same that mean different things. There is no conflict. It\'s just two different words that are spelled the same. Is this clear? Or am I misunderstanding your point altogether? [[User:RJII|RJII]] 08:20, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n::::::::::: I understand what your contention \'\'is\'\'.  My problem is that, according to the dictionary of philosophy I consulted, \"altruism\" as a doctrine (or technically, a type of doctrine) says that people ought to act with regards to the interests of others.  So what I don\'t understand is why you believe that the dictionary is wrong, unless you believe that it not is in a person\'s interest to not be harmed.

[http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~jphb/cp3349/Hall_Of_Fame/eth/ethice.htm#alturism] implies that I was correct, because it\'s unlikely that my misremembering of the dictionary would be word-for-word identical with some other definition.

Let\'s look at it. First of all, this is not really a definition of ethical altruism but a statement that a particular ethical view (\"\'\'that people sometimes ought to do what is in the interest of others and not in their self-interest\'\'\") \"can be considered a form of ethical altruism.\" This opens the possibility that there are other ethical views that can be considered a form of ethical altruism. For example, an ethical view that says people ALWAYS ought to do that, is a form of ethical altruism as well, I\'m sure you wouldn\'t dispute. So the question still remains, \"What is ethical altruism?\", rather than \"What particular ethical views can be considered FORMS of ethical altruism?\" (Apparently, the dictionary of philosophy you consulted had a definition of ethical altruism itself, but unfortunately, you didn\'t copy it down \"word for word.\") Now, if your ethical view is  \'\'that people sometimes ought to do what is in the interest of others and not in their self-interest\'\' then refraining from harming someone is not \'\'doing\'\' anything at all, but refraining from doing. If you go further and assert that that \'\'is\'\' the very \'\'definition\'\' of ethical altruism, then you are certainly in error to claim that refraining from harming people (not doing anything) is following the mandate of the doctrine. So, if you want to insist that refraining from going out and harming people (doing nothing) is doing what ethical altruism mandates, then where is the definition of ethical altruism itself that says it is a moral obligation to refrain from harming people? As far as I know, there is no such definition. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 16:41, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n::Clearly, we should define ethical altruism as an ethical belief that is in common between many different philosophies.  For example: \'\' \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: \'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.\' The second is this: \'Love your neighbor as yourself.\' There is no commandment greater than these.\" \'\' (Mark 12:29-31, NIV)  Notice that \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" implies concern for the person\'s well-being (\"love\" here can be translated as \"cherish\" \"have affection for\" and \"prove love for\") and doesn\'t make any distinction between action and inaction, helping and not hurting.  Similarly, utilitarianism is only concerned with the net impact on people\'s utility functions, requiring people to help other, and also not to hurt them.  Can you name a philosophy that says \"Help others, but you can hurt them also if you want to.\"?  I thought that I was in the majority when I thought that doing good to people is silly without similarly refraining from doing harm. [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 19:26, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n::You seem to be relying on finagling with action versus inaction (didn\'t you say that that was irrelevant somewhere?  Or were you talking about the practice of altruism?), and you are reading layers of meaning into the word \"do\".  If altruists were required to do things with regards to the interests of others, and \"do\" didn\'t allow for the possiblity of inaction, doesn\'t that mean that they aren\'t even allowed to sleep?  Why not snag the simultaneously more abstract and more practical concept that is supported by Christianity and utilitarianism (at least how I read them)? [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 19:29, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\n::: I don\'t know where you got your idea on utilitarianism from, but it\'s wrong. Utilitarianism can mandate outright killing of innocent people if that\'s going to maximize the greatest good for the greatest number. Utilitarianism is a type of \"consequentalism.\" Consequentialist philosophies say that the rightness or wrongness of an act is contingent upon the consequences of performing that act. Utilitarianism says that that act is right that \'\'maximizes\'\' good consequences (frequently taken to mean maximizing the greatest good for the greatest number). And, indeed, doing that can prescribe harming innocent people. That\'s widely seen as problem with utilitarianism. On the other hand there is \"deontology\" which says that the rightness or wrongness of an actions is NOT contingent upon the consequences of performing that act. A deontologist would say killing an innocent person is wrong even if it leads to good consequences, including utilitarian goals. It\'s too bad this is turning into a course on philosophy of ethics, but maybe that\'s what it takes to get you to understand that altruism is the name of an ethical doctrine says that people have a moral obligation to help others...to further their interests...to do what\'s good for them. The doctrine does not mandate that you refrain from harming others. That\'s an entirely different ethical doctrine. The ethical doctrine of altruism doesn\'t say that you have an obligation to refrain from harming people but that that you have an obligation to help them. There is a difference. One\'s set of ethics can include a rule against harming other people, while at the same time not having a rule that says he has an obligation to help other people. Now, let\'s look at utilitarianism in this context. Just as utilitarianism allows for harming people, so does an ethical doctrine of altruism if harming one person is going to help ten others. Even though you\'re harming people, the NET result is that you\'re helping people. Let\'s look at an example. There is one healthy person, and there are 5 unhealthy people who need organ transplants and are certain to die soon without them. If you have an ethical obligation to help people then it\'s perfectly permissible to kill the healthy person, harvest his organs, and transplant them to the 5 that would die otherwise. The NET effect is you are helping people. If you do nothing, you\'re not helping anyone ..one guys stays alive and the others die unnecessarily. If you do nothing are you doing what ethical altruism prescribes? Is altruism compatible with utilitarianism? Think about it. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 20:52, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n:::: I don\'t have time to read and think about this all, so I\'ll just start straight from my viewpoint: altruism is a class of ways of thinking about ethical problems.  An altruist has a set of options, and there are no guarantees about their nature -- the most ethical choice may involve hurting \'\'everyone\'\', if all the other choices are worse.  In order for a system of ethics to make it possible for a person to behave ethically in all circumstances, it \'\'must\'\' allow them to hurt others (through action or inaction), because that possibility can\'t be eliminated.  So, is the altruist who is chained up and thrown in jail being unethical because he/she isn\'t helping anybody?\n:::: Anyways, I\'m going to be out for a couple of days, and busy for a while after that, could you go out and find a neutral third party to comment on this whole mess?  I really don\'t have time to go into detail.  I\'ve been responding in the past with the hope that it would simply be a matter of trusting the overwhelming authority of outside authorities, but I keep getting dragged down into discussions I don\'t have the time to think about enough.

The former is supported if we, say, take Christianity as the \"reference implementation\" of altruism (or any other altruistic religious philosophy -- I just don\'t know my way around other scriptures to be able to point out what is laid down as the highest law.)  The latter allows people to murder the rich to give to the poor --- or murder the poor to give to the rich.  [[User:Paul Stansifer|Paul]][[User talk:Paul Stansifer|\'\'\'Stansifer\'\'\']] 05:04, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)\n\nThis is from the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Encyclopedia that may help: \"\'\'Ethical theory that regards the good of others as the end of moral action; by extension, the disposition to take the good of others as an end in itself. The term (French, altruisme, derived from Latin alter:\"other\") was coined in the 19th cent. by A. Comte and adopted generally as a convenient antithesis to egoism. Most altruists have held that each person has an obligation to further the pleasures and alleviate the pains of other people. The same argument holds if happiness, rather than pleasure, is taken as the end of life.\'\'\"  That is the complete entry on \"altruism.\"\n\n== Intro ==\n\n:\'\'Altruism is an unselfish interest in helping someone else or simply behavior that benefits someone else while affecting the actor detrimentally or neutrally. The former type of altruism is a motivation that emphasizes the welfare of others while minimizing or ignoring the individual\'s own welfare, while the latter is a description of behavior without regard to motivation.\'\'\n\n#There is something wrong in this logic: it seems that \"former\" and \"latter\" directions lost their meaning after some microedits.\n\n#The second problem of the definition is that [[free will]] is not mentioned. If \"altruism\" is forced upon someone, then it no longer can be called altruism. (In the extreme, a robber that makes you share your wealth with him (your act \'\'benefits someone else while affecting the actor detrimentally or...\'\') does not make your act altruistic.) Or at least the notions of \"free-will altruism\" and \"forced altrusm\"  must be clearly separated.  This IMO this is the root of the demise of all utopian and communist movements: you cannot force people to \"love thy neigbor\"  and expect good out of this. [[User:Mikkalai|Mikkalai]] 19:31, 27 Dec 2004 (UTC)\n\n:Since there are two kinds of altruism --one that describes motivation, and the other that describes behavior and results, if you force the latter kind of altruism on someone, then it is still altruism. The reason is that he is still behaving in a way that benefits others at net cost or neutrality to himself (behavior is still behavior whether it\'s coerced or not). It\'s \'\'\'not\'\'\' the \'\'other\'\' kind of altruism that refers to to motivation, for sure. These different things that are refered to be \"altruism\" are a source of a lot of confusion in communicating. Besides these kinds of altruism, there is something else called \"altruism\"...an ethical doctrine --which makes communication even more dysfunctional.

The man lives three miles up-town. It is bitter cold, snowing hard, midnight. He is about to enter the horse-car when a gray and ragged old woman, a touching picture of misery, puts out her lean hand and \nbegs for rescue from hunger and death. The man finds that he has a \'\'\'quarter\'\'\' in his pocket, but he does not hesitate: he gives it her and trudges home through the storm. There?it is noble, it is beautiful; its grace is marred by no fleck or blemish or suggestion of self-interest.  \n\nO.M. What makes you think that?\n\nY.M. Pray what else could I think? Do you imagine that there is some other way of looking at it?  \n\nO.M. Can you put yourself in the man\'s place and tell me what he felt and what he thought?\n\nY.M. Easily. The sight of that suffering old face pierced his generous heart with a sharp pain. He could not bear it. He could endure the three-mile walk in the storm, but he could \'\'\'not endure the tortures his conscience would suffer\'\'\' if he turned his back and left that poor old creature to perish. He would not have been able to sleep, for thinking of it.\n\nO.M. What was his state of mind on his way home?\n\nY.M. It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows. His heart sang, he was unconscious of the storm.  \n\nO.M. He felt well?\n\nY.M. One cannot doubt it.\n\nO.M. Very well. Now let us add up the details and see how much he got for his twenty-five cents. Let us try to find out the \'\'\'REAL\'\'\' why of his making the investment. In the first place HE couldn\'t bear the pain which the old suffering face gave him. So he was thinking of HIS pain?this good man. He must buy a salve for it. If he did not succor the old woman HIS conscience would torture him all the way home. Thinking of HIS pain again. He must buy relief for that. If he didn\'t relieve the old woman HE would not get any sleep. He must buy some sleep?still thinking of HIMSELF, you see. Thus, to sum up, he bought himself free of a sharp pain in his heart, he bought himself free of the tortures of a waiting conscience, he bought a whole night\'s sleep?all for twenty-five cents! \'\'\'It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself\'\'\'. On his way home his heart was joyful, and it sang?profit on top of profit! The impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was?\'\'\'FIRST\'\'\'?to CONTENT HIS OWN SPIRIT; secondly to relieve HER sufferings.

This is often presented as a call for altruism, i.e. the citizen are \'\'asked\'\' vehemently to do something voluntarily, which is a contradiction in itself. If the demand is not just pure rhetorics, then after some time, when many citizens have adopted the behaviour \"asked for\" in their propaganda, it is no longer a matter of choice to do so, because non-obeying citizens will soon be forced to obey. The result is, that there is often a steep road from what used to be true altruism in the beginning down to forced obedience in the end. Maybe this clarifies the argument of Mihnea Tudoreanu and RJII. --[[User:DenisDiderot|DenisDiderot]] 09:52, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n:I would argue that the only reason why politicians make use of altruist rhetoric in their speeches it because altruism is widely accepted as a sign of good moral values. Politicians don\'t appeal to altruism in particular, but to \'\'popular morality\'\' in general. It just so happens that altruism is a part of popular morality in our culture. Thus the road is not from \'\'altruism\'\' to obedience, but from \'\'popular morality\'\' to obedience. -- [[User:Mihnea Tudoreanu|Mihnea Tudoreanu]] 13:50, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n::That\'s not why politicians appeal to altruism.

But, if people really think something is in their own self-interest then there is no need to force it on them. When someone purchases something at the store, he does so because he thinks the product is going to benefit or please him in some way. That\'s where advertising comes in --as a salesman you would appeal to the customer\'s self interest (and note it has nothing to do with the customer believing that egoism is \"good and noble\"). If the customer really thinks giving the salesman money is going to give him pleasure or alleviate pain, he\'s going to do so --he\'ll make the purchase. Now, why wouldn\'t a politician use this tried and true technique of getting someone to part with his money? That is, why would he not offer someone of value to the citizen and ask him to purchase it? It\'s because the politician has nothing valuable to offer to the potential customer; he just wants money from one person to give to another person (called \'\'[[transfer payment]]s\'\') so that he can essentially purchase votes from whoever receives that money. How do you get a person to part with his money when he\'s not going to receive anything in exchange? You use a combination of altruistic rhetoric and force. Now, there may be some who think that giving money to the poor is in their own self-interest, but that\'s not who the politician is talking to. He\'s trying to \'\'convince\'\' a person who doesn\'t think that it\'s a \"good and nobel\" thing to give without receiving.

And, yes they do also appeal to the self-interest of people --such as taxes to insure their safety, etc. But, it\'s much less difficult to get people to pay to protect their own safety than it is to get them to pay for someone \'\'else\'s\'\' welfare. That\'s when altruism rhetoric comes in. If you can convince people they they have, or \'\'might have\'\', a moral obligation to help others then they\'re not going to protest as much when you tax them and, for a current example, send their money to Iraq.

Unfortunately, the feeling of duty seems to be equally or even more prevalent. If we \'\'\'truly\'\'\' wanted to help other people and this feeling really guided us, we wouldn\'t let the feeling of loyalty and duty stand in our way so often, e.g. when war is raised against other countries or when human rights are violated. Mihnea, do you know of any historical epochs and regions on earth in which you wouldn\'t characterize the majority of the people as altruistic? --[[User:DenisDiderot|DenisDiderot]] 23:26, 28 December 2005 (UTC)\n\n::I think it might be going a bit too far to characterize the majority of the people today as altruistic in their actions.

If you ask, \"is an altruist a good person?\", the vast majority will say yes. Politicians want to give the impression that they are good persons. Hence, in our society, they almost always claim to be altruists.\n\n::Western society is morally altruistic due to the influence of [[Christianity]]. Interestingly, the other major world religions - [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] - also promote altruistic morality. Perhaps this article needs a section on altruism and religion. Societies with non-altruistic morality are largely extinct today (again, very interesting - perhaps altruism gives some sort of evolutionary advantage to the societies that adopt it as their morality? That would explain why it exists in the first place). Nevertheless, societies with non-altruistic morality did exist in the past.

On the other hand Christianity resulted in the death of the Roman Empire.  The rise of Europe only occured as Christianity declined in influence.  Most modern societies are thoroughly non altruistic.  In fact almost all the present day successful societies are based on extreme individualism and selfishness.  They are also incredibly successful.  Futhermore, I would say the true advantage of altruism is not that it works well for societies but rather that human beings like the idea of it.  I believe this is because we evolved in a hunter gatherer society where altruistic behaviour was necessary for the survival of the tribe.  In our modern society this is no longer the case but we still cling to outmoded evolutionary behaviour.  Thus we very strongly appreciate altruism even though it is no longer necessary in most contexts and can even be very harmful.\n\n==Temporary truce in edit war==\nI maintain my position that the version of the \"Altruism in politics\" section written by [[User:RJII]] gives far too much room and credence to fringe views. ([[Objectivism]] is really about the \'\'only\'\' modern-day movement I know of that would flat-out say altruism is bad, and this is clearly fringe territory.) Nonetheless, in order to prevent edit warring, I have incorporated a table so that \'\'both\'\' versions of this section are visible in the article. This should only be a temporary step until the [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/RJII v. Firebug|current dispute resolution process]] involving RJII is completed. Many individuals have provided evidence there and it is clear that the community as a whole is fed up with this user\'s actions. Hopefully, that ruling will provide a permanent resolution, preferably one that prevents any further POV-pushing on RJII\'s part. <TT>[[User:Crotalus horridus|Crotalus horridus]] <SMALL>([[User talk:Crotalus horridus|TALK]] ?

All I\'m doing is inputing sourceable information. I\'m not even that familiar with Objectivism, so I don\'t know how I could be pushing objectivism. Altruism was opposed long before Ayn Rand --Nietzsche, Proudhon, Warren, etc. You can \'\'\'go cry to administrators\'\'\' all you want, but there is no rule against providing sourceable information that happens to favor a particular POV. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 04:09, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::I endorse the fork on the left. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 07:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n::I wrote the majority of material in both. I\'m also the creator of the section itself. I think the one on the left misses the mark though due to some edits from another user that misses the point. The point is that helping others can be voluntary or it can be enforced. The belief that helping others is a moral obligation (ethical altruism) takes a political turn when those that believe that it is a moral obligation employ government to \'\'require\'\' individuals to help others. That\'s what the section should focus on. The section on the left is watered down, nearly meaningless, and doesn\'t really say anything interesting. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 07:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n:::The government isn\'t an individual, it\'s the collective head of society, so the notion of altruism doesn\'t apply very well.  If one individual helps another, that can be considered altruism.  If part of society helps another part, is that altruism or just collective egoism?  Frankly, it\'s around here that the distinction falls apart, which is why I think the right-hand fork is comparatively muddled. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 08:06, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n::::You\'re not seeing the distinction between altruism the act, and altruism the ethical doctrine. Helping someone is just that --helping someone. If it\'s done without self-interest, it\'s the ACT of altruism --if it\'s done out of self-interest it\'s the act of self-interested benevolence. The \'\'\'ethical doctrine\'\'\' of altruism is something altogether different. It a BELIEF --a belief that individuals have an OBLIGATION to help others. If someone thinks you have a moral obligation to help the poor then he is likely to vote for government programs \'\'requiring\'\' that upon you help others --such as taxing you and sending your money to hungry people in the 3rd world. That\'s when the \'\'ethical doctrine\'\' has a political effect. You know that when people think something is moral or immoral, one of the first things a large part of these people (but not everyone) want to to do is to have government enforce that morality. An [[individualist]] (of which a large number are egoists) opposes any other individual imposing his positive morality on another (through government or not) --he thinks that each individual should be allowed to choose and act on his own morality as long as he doesn\'t impose it on anyone else. Hence, you have political conflict --between those that want government to enforce what is perceived to be, by some, a moral obligation to help the needy and those who think people should be left to mind their own business. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 15:43, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::If I help out someone who\'s unemployed, keeping him afloat while they get a job, there isn\'t necessarily any concrete benefit to me.  After all, he\'s the one who got the job and I didn\'t make a penny, so it\'s not unreasonable for me to claim altruism.\n::::But if the government does the same thing, it does get to benefit from this action, because now he\'s doing work, earning money and paying taxes, as opposed to living on the street, eating out of dumpsters and panhandling.  Because the government is the head of society, it benefits when citizens benefit, rendering it much less capable of \"true\" altruism because it can\'t easily claim a lack of compensation.  Really, what it\'s doing is making an investment in one of its members by extending its societal safety net, which is just reciprocal altruism.\n:::::Moreover, when the government uses part of my taxes to help that him find a job, it\'s not forcing altruism on me, it\'s acting in its own interest, redistributing its funds so as to benefit not only him but its collective self.  From my point of view, I can\'t claim altruism because, in return for my taxes, I get rights and services unavailable otherwise, so I benefit by paying.  This is likewise reciprocal altruism.\n:::::In addition, I could argue that helping him in my indirect interest for people to be a productive part of the economy and also in my join interests as a member of society.  I could also argue that it is in my direct interest because, as a person with normal level of empathy, I enjoy helping people who genuinely need it and honestly feel that it\'s a good thing when people prosper instead of fail.  (Granted, sociopaths and extreme libertarians can deny that last part.)\n:::::Fundamentally, the big problem with \"true\" altruism is that it\'s defined in terms of the actor not benefiting, which makes benefit harder to avoid when that actor is a collective that includes all affected individuals.  For this reason, I don\'t think it\'s meaningful to speak of governmental social service as forced altruism. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 16:30, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n::::::I fully agree that forcing someone to help another is not \"forced altruism.\" Rather, it\'s forcing someone to do what the \'\'ethical doctrine\'\' of altruism prescribes because he won\'t do it on his own. Whether someone benefits or not from being forced to aid others is irrelevant in terms of the \'\'ethical doctrine\'\'. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 17:51, 20 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n(resetting indentation, for the sake of readability)\n\nActually, this isn\'t about force at all.  The individuals pay taxes because it\'s in their interest to do so, and the government helps out that unemployed person because doing so is in it\'s interest.  Everyone is acting in their own interest, which means it\'s neither altruistic nor forced. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 04:12, 22 January 2006 (UTC)\n:I\'ve got some news for you. Paying taxes isn\'t optional. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 18:08, 22 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Sure it is.  Just like following other laws is optional.  Of course, if I don\'t hold up my end of the social contract, on what basis do I have rights? [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 05:09, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::If someone refuses to pay taxes, he goes to jail. In addition, if the taxes go to help others rather than himself it\'s an even greater violation of his consent (given that he does not consent). That means the action is coerced rather than voluntary. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 05:14, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::If someone breaks the law, they lose the rights they earned by following the law.  For that matter, a free rider who wants to benefit from society without paying into it \'\'deserves\'\' to be penalized for the attempt. If you really don\'t want to pay taxes, all you have to do is go live where you don\'t benefit from society.  However, your refusal to do so forces society to keep on helping you, so you\'re the one initiating force. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 05:32, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::::What\'s that got to do with the ethic of altruism? The point is what the taxes are used for, not the taxation itself. If you think I should give some of my money to the poor in Somalia, and you\'re a legislator, you will be prone to push for government to tax me to send me money to Somalia. Are you trying to tell me that would be voluntary on my part? [[User:RJII|RJII]] 05:42, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::::The point I made earlier is that it\'s not altruism on anyone\'s part.  [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 05:46, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::::::The point you\'re not seeing is that this is not about ACTS of altruism, but about the ETHICAL DOCTRINE of altruism --the assertion that people have a moral OBLIGATION to help others. They\'re two different things. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 05:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n(reset indent)\n\nUhm, in the example I gave, there\'s no altruism of either kind. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 06:24, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n:In the example I gave, there is. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 06:25, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Stil no.  The gov is giving aid to Somalia because it wants the benefits that come from doing so.  The taxpayer is paying taxes because they want the benefits that come from doing so.  They\'re serving their own interests.  The fact that other interests are served does not suffice to cancel this out. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 06:48, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::No, the government is taxing you to send your money to Somalia because those who passed the law think you have a moral obligation to help others. This is so, simply because this is the example I gave. I don\'t know why this is so hard for you to understand. The idea is that if someone thinks people have a moral obligation to help others, they may employ government to force people to help others. I\'m not arguing whether this actually happens or not, though I positively know that it does. I\'m noting it because other writers, political philosophers, etc. have noted it to be a danger of the doctrine, so it should be noted in the article. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 06:54, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::As I pointed out, the government is getting a benefit for spending part of its resources this way, hence it cannot be considered purely altruistic.  Likewise, the individual benefits from paying into taxes, so there\'s no altruism there, either.  The only way you get the illusion of one person being helped at the expense of another is if you carefully zoom in only on the isolated individuals while excluding all benefits on the personal and collective level.  When you zoom out far enough to see the big picture, there\'s no place left for the illusion of altruism to hide. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 07:01, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::::You still haven\'t grasped that this is about the ETHICAL DOCTRINE, not the ACT of helping someone at the expense of another. It has nothing at all to do with that. Even if the government forcing a person to help someone else benefits the person that\'s being forced, if it\'s being done because it\'s believed that the person has a moral obligation to help someone, then it\'s the political manifestation of the ethical doctrine of altruism. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 07:04, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n(reset)\n\nIf helping you helps me, I have a moral oblgiation to do so.  If helping you harms me, I do not.  In the above examples, we have the former case, not the latter, so there is no altruism.  Even if, for example, the government stated that its policies were altruistic or that its goals were based on the ethical doctrine of altruism, this would not make it so. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 07:08, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n:Of course it would make it so. It doesn\'t matter whether you are ultimately benefit or suffer by the action. All that matters is that the government is making you help others because it thinks you have a moral obligation to help others. It\'s as simple as that. Note that the ethical doctrine doesn\'t say that you have an obligation to be altruistic; it simply says you have an obligation to help others. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 07:13, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::Today, I gave a stranger $5.  In return, they gave me lunch.  As it happens, the stranger was standing behind the counter of a take-out Chinese restaurant.  So, was I being altruistic or was there an exchange of value?  Now apply this to the scenario where the government helps out a citizen who is unemployed, or even helps feed a Somolian.  So long as there is an exchange of value, in what sense is it altruistic? Stated altruism is just a statement. If helping others helps me, then I have an obligation to myself to help myself, even if that means helping others as a consequence. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 07:26, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n:::The doctrine commands that you help others. If a government forces you to trade with someone because it thinks you have a moral obligation to help that person, then even if you benefit from the trade government has enforced the ethical doctrine of altruism. The ACT isn\'t altruism, of course! But, that\'s not the issue. The issue is that ethical doctrine has been enforced. [[User:RJII|RJII]] 07:32, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n::::When the gov extends a safety net so that someone who loses their job can get another one instead of falling through the cracks, the gov is helping itself.  Hence, neither sort of altruism is involved.  Perhaps the gov explains or justifies this decision in terms of the moral obligation towards the ethical doctrine of altruism, perhaps not. Either way, the reality is that it\'s long-term self interest.  Of course, that\'s really the point I\'m making here; all ostensible altruism either boils down to long-term self interest or to an error. [[User:Alienus|Alienus]] 18:09, 25 January 2006 (UTC)\n\n==Original research?==\n\nThis section strikes me as \'\'original researchy\'\'. For example \"With regard to their political convictions, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice (and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated), and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced, if possible, by all human beings.\" &mdash; I\'m not sure there is much sense in that at all.  - [[User:f-m-t|FrancisTyers]] [[User_talk:f-m-t|?]] 20:15, 25 June 2006 (UTC)\n\n===Altruism in politics===\nSome opponents of the \'\'ethical doctrine\'\' called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others) argue that the doctrine is dangerous as it can lead to violations of individual liberty if the state enforces the principle. For example, [[David Kelley]] says, \"If self-sacrifice is an ideal--if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action--why not force people to act accordingly?\" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a collectivist political system.\n\nWith regard to their political convictions, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe altruism is a matter of personal choice (and therefore selfishness can and should be tolerated), and those who believe that altruism is a moral ideal which should be embraced, if possible, by all human beings.\n\nA prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is [[Lysander Spooner]], who, in \'\'Natural Law\'\', writes: \"\'\'Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.\'\'\" Things such as a law that motorists pull over to let emergency vehicles pass may also be justified by appealing to the altruism ethic. Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things further and advocate some form of [[collectivism]] or [[communalism]].\n\nOn a somewhat related note, altruism is often held - even by non-altruists - to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power. Such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace. When they do not, they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own.'

The ASA became the United States of America Standards Institute or USASI<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|211}} and ultimately the [[American National Standards Institute]].\n\n===Bit width===\nThe X3.2 subcommittee designed ASCII based on the earlier [[teleprinter]] encoding systems. Like other [[character encoding]]s, ASCII specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and [[character (computing)|character]] symbols (i.e. [[grapheme]]s and [[control character]]s). This allows [[Digital data|digital]] devices to communicate with each other and to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information such as written language. Before ASCII was developed, the encodings in use included 26 [[English alphabet|alphabetic]] characters, 10 [[numerical digit]]s, and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols. To include all these, and control characters compatible with the [[CCITT|Comit? Consultatif International T?l?phonique et T?l?graphique]] (CCITT) [[International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2]] (ITA2) standard, [[Fieldata]], and early [[EBCDIC]], more than 64 codes were required for ASCII.\n\nThe committee debated the possibility of a [[Shift code|shift]] function (like in [[ITA2]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [[six-bit character code|six-bit code]]. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]] as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|215, 236&thinsp;?&thinsp;4}}\n\nThe committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. However, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. The committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. Since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|217, 236&thinsp;?&thinsp;5}} [[Eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.<ref>{{cite book |authors=Stanley A.

The first two columns (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|220, 236&thinsp;?&thinsp;8,9)}} The [[Space (punctuation)|\"space\" character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>;<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|237&thinsp;?&thinsp;10}} for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. The committee decided it was important to support [[upper case|uppercase]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ASCII so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|228, 237&thinsp;?&thinsp;14}} as was done in the [[DEC SIXBIT]] code. [[Lower case|Lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase.

Thus, in ASCII <code>!\"#$%</code> were placed in second column, rows 1?5, corresponding to the digits 1?5 in the adjacent column. The parentheses could not correspond to \'\'9\'\' and \'\'0\'\', however, because the place corresponding to \'\'0\'\' was taken by the space character. This was accommodated by removing <code>_</code> (underscore) from \'\'6\'\' and shifting the remaining characters left, which corresponded to many European typewriters that placed the parentheses with \'\'8\'\' and \'\'9\'\'. This discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[Teletype Model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ASCII, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. Electric typewriters, notably the more recently introduced [[IBM Selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers{{mdashb}}following the [[IBM PC]] (1981), especially [[Model M]] (1984){{mdashb}}and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ASCII table as earlier keyboards did. The <code>/?</code> pair also dates to the No. 2, and the <code>,&lt; .&gt;</code> pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the No. 2, did not shift <code>,</code> (comma) or <code>.</code> (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). However, ASCII split the <code>;:</code> pair (dating to No. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly <code>-* =+</code>) to <code>:* ;+ -=</code>.\n\nSome common characters were not included, notably <code>???</code>, while <code>^`~</code> were included as diacritics for international use, and <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters <code>\\|</code> (in addition to common <code>/</code>). The \'\'@\'\' symbol was not used in continental Europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented \'\'?\'\' in the French variation, so the \'\'@\'\' was placed in position 40<sub>[[hexadecimal|hex]]</sub>, right before the letter A.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|243}}\n\nThe control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (SOM), end of address (EOA), [[End of Message|end of message]] (EOM), end of transmission (EOT), \"who are you?\" (WRU), \"are you?\" (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned to maximize the [[Hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|243?5}}\n\n===Publication===\nWith the other special characters and control codes filled in, ASCII was published as ASA X3.4-1963, leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization, and one unassigned control code.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|66, 245}} There was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet.<ref name=\"kenz\"/>{{rp|435}} The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 the CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to columns 6 and 7,<ref>Brief Report: Meeting of CCITT Working Party on the New Telegraph Alphabet, May 13?15, 1963.</ref> and [[International Organization for Standardization]] TC 97 SC 2 voted during October to incorporate the change into its draft standard.<ref>Report of ISO/TC/97/SC 2 ?

They proposed a [[9-track]] standard for magnetic tape, and attempted to deal with some forms of [[punched card]] formats.\n\n===Use===\nASCII itself was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for [[American Telephone & Telegraph]]\'s TWX (TeletypeWriter eXchange) network. TWX originally used the earlier five-bit [[ITA2]], which was also used by the competing [[Telex]] teleprinter system. [[Bob Bemer]] introduced features such as the [[Escape character|escape sequence]].<ref name=\"Brandel\" /> His British colleague [[Hugh McGregor Ross]] helped to popularize this work{{snd}} according to Bemer, \"so much so that the code that was to become ASCII was first called the Bemer-Ross Code in Europe\".<ref>Bob Bemer (n.d.).

Martha M. Gray.<ref>http://csrc.nist.gov/fips/fips1861.pdf</ref> /* ?? */ -->\nOn March 11, 1968, U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] mandated that all computers purchased by the United States federal government support ASCII, stating:<ref>Lyndon B. Johnson (March 11, 1968). [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=28724 Memorandum Approving the Adoption by the Federal Government of a Standard Code for Information Interchange]. \'\'The American Presidency Project\'\'.

Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include [[ISCII]] (India), [[VISCII]] (Vietnam), and [[YUSCII]] (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard.\n\nASCII was incorporated into the [[Unicode]] character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ASCII characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. This allows [[UTF-8]] to be [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ASCII, as a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters is identical to an ASCII file containing the same sequence of characters.  Even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ASCII characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ASCII extensions such as ISO-8859-1) will preserve UTF-8 data unchanged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/utf-8.7.html |title=utf-8(7) - Linux manual page |publisher=Man7.org |date=2014-02-26 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==ASCII control characters==\n{{main|Control character}}\n\nASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0?31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]]) that make use of ASCII, or to provide [[Metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.\n\nFor example, character 10 represents the \"line feed\" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents \"backspace\". RFC 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[Whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.<ref>RFC 2822 (April 2001). \"NO-WS-CTL\".</ref> Except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ASCII does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. Other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.\n\nThe original ASCII standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. The ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of \"delete\".\n\nProbably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. Paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON), 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF), and 127 ([[Delete key|Delete]]) became de facto standards. The Model 33 was also notable for taking the description of Control-G (BEL, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a BEL character.  Because the keytop for the O key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ASCII-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (Control-O, Shift In) interpreted as \"delete previous character\" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.\n\nWhen a Teletype 33 ASR equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, \"transmit on\") caused the tape reader to resume.  This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a \"handshaking\" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q is replaced by a second Control-S to resume output.  The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and <s>TAPE</s> respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last=McConnell|first=Robert|title=Understanding ASCII Codes|url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm|accessdate=2014-05-11|author2=Haynes, James |author3=Warren, RIchard }}</ref>\n\nCode 127 is officially named \"delete\" but the Teletype label was \"rubout\". Since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. The original Teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as NUL (all zeroes). This was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html|title=Re: editor and word processor history (was: Re: RTF for emacs)}}</ref> Tapes designed to be \"hand edited\" could even be produced with spaces of extra NULs (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be \"rubbed out\" and then replacements put into the empty space.\n\nSome software assigned special meanings to ASCII characters sent to the software from the terminal. Operating systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], for example, interpreted DEL as an input character as meaning \"remove previously-typed input character\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/DEC-6-0-EX-SYS-UM-IP-PRE00_Multiprogramming_System_Manual_1965.pdf|title=PDP-6 Multiprogramming System Manual|page=43|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]|year=1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_PDP-10_Ref/1970PDP10Ref_Part3.pdf|title=PDP-10 Reference Handbook, Book 3, Communicating with the Monitor|page=5-5|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]|year=1969}}</ref> and this interpretation also became common in Unix systems. Most other systems used BS for that meaning and used DEL to mean \"remove the character at the cursor\".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} That latter interpretation is the most common now.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nMany more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. The \"escape\" character (ESC, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. This is the same meaning of \"escape\" encountered in URL encodings, [[C (programming language)|C language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. Over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. In modern use, an ESC sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence, usually in the form of a so-called \"[[ANSI escape code]]\" (or, more properly, a \"[[Control Sequence Introducer]]\") beginning with ESC followed by a \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>\" (left-bracket) character. An ESC sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. In [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, ESC generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.\n\nThe inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring \"plain text\" files between systems. The best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. Teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both \"Carriage Return\" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and \"Line Feed\" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). The name \"Carriage Return\" comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  The entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.\n\n[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] operating systems ([[OS/8]], [[RT-11]], [[RSX-11]], [[RSTS/E|RSTS]], [[TOPS-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[Teleprinter|Teletype machines]]) would work. By the time so-called \"glass TTYs\" (later called CRTs or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. When [[Gary Kildall]] cloned [[RT-11]] to create [[CP/M]] he followed established [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] convention.  Until the introduction of [[PC DOS]] in 1981, [[IBM]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used EBCDIC instead of ASCII and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. IBM\'s [[PC DOS]] (also marketed as [[MS-DOS]] by Microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of [[CP/M]], and [[Windows]] inherited it from MS-DOS.\n\nUnfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. To simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[Multics]]<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=Technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |last1=Ossanna |first1=J.

[[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems, and [[Amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from Multics. The original [[Macintosh OS]], [[Apple DOS]], and [[ProDOS]], on the other hand, used carriage return (CR) alone as a line terminator; however, since Apple replaced these operating systems with the Unix-based [[OS&nbsp;X]] operating system, they now use line feed (LF) as well.\n\nComputers attached to the [[ARPANET]] included machines running operating systems such as TOPS-10 and [[TOPS-20#TENEX|TENEX]] using CR-LF line endings, machines running operating systems such as Multics using LF line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[OS/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[EBCDIC]] rather than ASCII.  The [[Telnet]] protocol defined an ASCII \"Network Virtual Terminal\" (NVT), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. Telnet used ASCII along with CR-LF line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the NVT.<ref>{{cite IETF|title=TELNET Protocol|rfc=158|pages=4-5|author=T.

For this reason, EOF, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] for Control-Z instead of SUBstitute.  The end-of-text code ([[End-of-text character|ETX]]), also known as [[Control-C]], was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using Z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient [[Mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. A historically common and still prevalent convention uses the ETX code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.\n\nIn C library and [[Unix]] conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|strings]]; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as ASCIZ or ASCIIZ, where here Z stands for \"zero\".\n\n===ASCII control code chart===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

To delete the previous character, one had to back up the paper tape punch, which for mechanical and simplicity reasons was a button on the punch itself and not the keyboard, then type the rubout character. They therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. When systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the \"rubout\" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo \"<code>^H</code>\" for backspace). Other terminals not designed for paper tape made the key at this location produce Backspace, and systems designed for these used that character to back up. Since the delete code often produced a backspace effect, this also forced terminal manufacturers to make any {{keypress|Delete}} key produce something other than the Delete character.}}\n|}\n\nOther representations might be used by specialist equipment, for example [[ISO 2047]] graphics or [[hexadecimal]] numbers.\n\n==ASCII printable characters==\n<!-- Section header linked to from redirects -->\nCodes 20<sub>[[hexadecimal|16]]</sub> to 7E<sub>[[hexadecimal|16]]</sub>, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Accessed 2008-04-14.</ref> us, IBM367, cp367, and csASCII.\n\nOf these, the IANA encourages use of the name \"US-ASCII\" for Internet uses of ASCII (even if it is a [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym]], but the US is needed because of abuse of the ASCII term). One often finds this in the optional \"charset\" parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent \"meta\" element of some [[HTML]] documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prologue of some [[XML]] documents.\n\n==Variants==\nAs computer technology spread throughout the world, different [[Standardization|standards bodies]] and corporations developed many variations of ASCII to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as \"[[Extended ASCII|ASCII extensions]]\", although some misuse that term to represent all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII\'s character-map in the 7-bit range. Furthermore, the ASCII extensions have also been mislabelled as ASCII.\n\nMany other countries developed variants of ASCII to include non-English letters (e.g. [[?]], [[?]], [[?]], [[?]]), currency symbols (e.g. [[?]], [[?]]), etc.\n\nThe [[PETSCII]] code [[Commodore International]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ASCII-1963, instead of the more common ASCII-1967, such as found on the [[ZX Spectrum character set|ZX Spectrum]] computer. [[ATASCII|Atari]] 8-bit computers and [[Galaksija (computer)#Character ROM|Galaksija]] computers also used ASCII variants.\n\n===7-bit===\n{{See also|UTF-7}}\nFrom early in its development,<ref>\"Specific Criteria,\" attachment to memo from R. W. Reach, \"X3-2 Meeting ? September 14 and 15,\" September 18, 1961</ref> ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as [[ISO/IEC 646]] (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several [[code point]]s reserved for \"national use.\"  However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO\'s first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967<ref>R. Mar?chal, ISO/TC 97 ? Computers and Information Processing: Acceptance of Draft ISO Recommendation No. 1052, December 22, 1967</ref> caused ASCII\'s choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.\n\nISO/IEC 646, like ASCII, was a 7-bit character set. It did not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. Escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.\n\nBecause the bracket and brace characters of ASCII were assigned to \"national use\" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of ISO/IEC 646, a German, French, or Swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of ISO/IEC 646, rather than ASCII, had to write, and thus read, something such as\n\n:<code>? a?i? = \'?n\'; ?</code>\n\ninstead of\n\n:<code>{ a[i] = \'\\n\'; }</code>\n\n[[C trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ANSI C]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. Many programmers kept their computers on US-ASCII, so plain-text in Swedish, German etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[Usenet]]) contained \"{, }\" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. For example, a Swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get \"N{ jag har sm|rg}sar.\" as the answer, which should be \"N? jag har sm?rg?sar.\" meaning \"No I\'ve got sandwiches.\"\n\n===8-bit===\n{{See also|UTF-8}}\nEventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ASCII. In most cases these developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.\n\nMost early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0?31 with more graphics. [[Kaypro]] [[CP/M]] computers used the \"upper\" 128 characters for the Greek alphabet. The IBM PC defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as [[Emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. Operating systems such as [[DOS]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[IBM PC]]s supported them in hardware. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] developed the [[Multinational Character Set]] (DEC-MCS) for use in the popular [[VT220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. The Macintosh defined [[Mac OS Roman]] and Postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC 8859]] standard (derived from the DEC-MCS) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ASCII, but with many substitutions). A popular further extension designed by Microsoft, [[Windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as ISO-8859-1), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ASCII were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[UTF-8]] became more common.<ref name=\"utf-8-2008\" />\n\nISO/IEC 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80&ndash;9F [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ASCII encoding to become an 8-bit system.<ref>{{cite book |author=The Unicode Consortium |editor-first=Julie D. |editor-last=Allen |title=The Unicode standard, Version 5.0 |date=2006-11-03 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0321480910 |chapterurl=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2015 |chapter-format=PDF |chapter=Chapter 13: Special Areas and Format Characters |page=314}}</ref>\n\n===Unicode===\n{{See also|Basic Latin (Unicode block)}}\n\n[[Unicode]] and the ISO/IEC 10646 [[Universal Character Set]] (UCS) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII is limited to 128 characters, Unicode and the UCS support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called \'\'code points\'\') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] and [[UTF-32]]).\n\nTo allow backward compatibility, the 128 ASCII and 256 ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1) characters are assigned Unicode/UCS code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards. Therefore, ASCII can be considered a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode/UCS, and ASCII (when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit) is valid UTF-8.\n\n==Order==\nASCII-code order is also called \'\'ASCIIbetical\'\' order.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=ASCIIbetical&i=38025,00.asp |title=ASCIIbetical definition |magazine=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> [[Collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than \"standard\" alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). The main deviations in ASCII order are:\n* All uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, \"Z\" comes before \"a\"\n* Digits and many punctuation marks come before letters; for example, \"4\" precedes \"one\"\n* Numbers are sorted na?vely as strings; for example, \"10\" precedes \"2\"\n\nAn intermediate order{{mdashb}}readily implemented{{mdashb}}converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ASCII values. Na?ve number sorting can be averted by [[Leading zero|zero-filling]] all numbers (e.g. \"02\" will sort before \"10\" as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computing}}\n\n* [[3568 ASCII]], an asteroid named after the character encoding\n* [[Ascii85]]\n* [[ASCII art]]\n* [[ASCII Ribbon Campaign]]\n* [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)]] (ASCII as a subset of Unicode)\n* [[Extended ASCII]]\n* [[HTML decimal character rendering]]\n* [[List of Unicode characters]]\n* [[Jargon File]], a glossary of computer programmer slang which includes a list of common slang names for ASCII characters\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|40em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!--I\'m adding some additional resources here, both for the benefit of readers, and for use in providing inline citations for currently uncited items, above.
